impossible is nothing! or adidas is all in!

what personality does the brand adidas portray? as we go by the tagline, does it depict the rebellious optimists like they’ve cited on their website?

right from its inception, the brand has been using lowercase in its name. When dug a bit, the logo has gone through a design change four times yet one thing that remained untouched is the lowercase letters. to be precise, the ‘a’ in adidas. wondered why? what could be the motive?

well, the answer is, that the lowercase ‘a’ represents, inclusion and accessibility. the brand and the founder adolf ‘adi’ dassler wanted to create sportswear accessible to everyone and not just ultra-athletic.

and what does it convey to the current world and before too?

first, the simplicity. all four logos and the intact lowercase A in adidas are #minimal and concise. second, it encapsulates the core value of authenticity and a deep-rooted connection to its origin. third, the sense of humility and approachability it ascertains while maintaining a distinctive brand identity. lastly, it has become a hallmark of the brand, symbolising its commitment to quality in the world of sportswear.
