Marketing teams are constantly looking for content. And most of the content is targeted for creating posts on social media. Resultantly, there’s an endless hustle for videos, infographics, written posts and images.

Almost everyone, every brand, is posting some content or the other all the time. But, honestly, how much of such content is engaging and useful for consumers of social media? And is social media the only vehicle for dissemination of such content? Also, is it true that people are only watching content as opposed to reading content? So, does that mean that marketers must use more video content instead of writing blog posts or generating posts on social media with written content?

At FBL we have researched extensively on these crucial questions and aspects of marketing. We understand that some of these perceived consumer behaviors are founded on myths and some are a result of marketers’ anxiety with wanting to stand out in the crowded online marketplace.

Our experience over the last 15 years in working as a marketing advisory with brands and businesses has taught us that as long as the content is of high quality, it doesn’t necessarily have to be only video or short. Which is, content which is non-video or even long posts of written content work for marketing purposes.

    - We follow a few key principles for creating high-quality content:
    - Be crisp: What are you trying to tell your prospective customer? Is it sharp?
    - Be clear: Does your content make a powerful case for your brand, product or service? Does it outline the value proposition in terms of costs and features? Can you define your pitch in a single line?
    - Be creative: Can your pitch translate into a powerful creative – as a headline or a visual graphic or as a 30-second audio or video capsule?
    - Be consistent: Whatever form of content you choose to use, be sure it is generated consistently. Whether video or written or audio, keep the content coming at regular intervals. Also, in each capsule of your content, keep the communication of the brand’s value proposition consistent.

Be anecdotal: Let your content tell a story. It can be a true customer use case. Or you can weave a story around how you want the customer to benefit from your product or service. When people hear or read stories that appeal to them, they remember those stories. That’s really how you build better recall for your brand.

While there is no one way of creating engaging content, what must be understood that is content that is not engaging is never remembered. For instance, none of us can recall the names of boring books we have read or boring movies that we have watched. Yet, those books and those movies that have left a deep impact on us are still vividly remembered by us. So it is with simple, powerful marketing campaigns of the past. You can still recall a favorite jingle or tagline or TV commercial. Think about these: “Yeh dil maange more” (Pepsi), “Hamara Bajaj”, “Boost is the secret of my energy”, “Don’t leave home without it” (AmEx) or “The Citi never sleeps”.

In a way, all of these marketing campaigns were built around interesting content and used across multiple media platforms.
Now, think of all the video and written content that you have consumed on social media in the last few years. How many of them have been really memorable? Can you recall them now? How many of them will you be able to recall in a jiffy 25 years from now?

Well, it is in your answer to those two questions that you can really come to appreciate the value of creating memorable content around your brand. Come to us at FBL. We will help you do just that.
