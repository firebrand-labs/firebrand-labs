treat others as you would like to get treated.

not too long ago, did we realise how the workplace has fundamentally changed?

the concept of a traditional whip-wielding, nasty-tongued, unruly boss has now been replaced by people with a lot of experience, empathy and enigma mentoring younglings. thanks to the startup culture and an immersive global workforce paving way for a more human-centric workplace.

if amazon was built with customer centric culture, we are building firebrand labs, putting our people at the heart of everything we do. some of our people centric initiatives include:

    - hiring right

    ensuring we hire the right person for the right job versus hire and fire. our first colleague, still works here.

    - work around life

    forget work life balance. welcome to embracing life as we progress into our work years. our work schedules are intertwined with life’s commitments.

    - celebrations

    we take birthdays, anniversaries and other milestones seriously. celebrations are serious affairs here.

    - bonding

    this is a mindful act. every colleague is made to connect with each other. bonding is a business priority for every manager.

    - leading and managing

    micro or macro management is passe. embracing the need to leading by example and managing expectations everyday.

    - constant feedback

    there’s a process in place to let the supervisor and the team member go through a structured feedback session, every month.

our employer value proposition (EVP)
_a workplace that is employee centric, friendly and authentic. work we do here matters to our customers, and their customers._
