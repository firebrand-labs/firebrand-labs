Thanks to the pandemic, content is created for the entire world today. Thanks to OTT platforms, you could sit in Antarctica and experience an Akshay Kumar movie. What’s even more enjoyable? OTT platforms have become behemoth production houses by themselves, right from Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar, and Sony Liv; all of them have their own production houses for content creation pays, especially in the entertainment era where convenience and entertainment drive action.

However, to paraphrase Barney Stinson, ‘Nothing is ever truly awesome until there is a community to experience it!’. Community, I believe, is the bedrock of content creation. Today, DC, Marvel and other comic book-related brands leverage the power of the community through events such as the San Diego Comic-Con and Fandom Clubs and more to further their cause and create advocacy.

Fortunately for Netflix and unfortunately for the world, no other OTT platform has focused on communities created around their platforms to drive increased advocacy. Presenting Netflix Tudum!

What is Tudum? Remember the sound that comes as the iconic N of Netflix loads on your device? TUDUMMMMM! Netflix Tudum is a community for hardcore Netflix users, fans of their TV shows, fan fiction connoisseurs, reviewers, movie buffs, tv buffs and more! It is a great way to reiterate the importance of a community while creating an experience. Tudum features behind the screen experiences of your favourite tv shows, shareable clips of top scenes from your favourite series, curated guides for novice Netflix users, explainer videos for the true blue fan and more.

How does this help Netflix? Rudimentarily, it helps create affiliate SEO traffic given the relevance and keyword density packed into the community. It also gives users a chance to experience more from their favourite show, rekindling their interest in watching it again.

Furthermore, it creates true fans who contribute to the conversation around a particular show, thereby increasing Netflix’s value as a production house. Exciting times are ahead, especially for Netflix, given that they are now venturing into community creation, game creation, and e-commerce. Do we have another Apple or Amazon on the cards? Only time will tell.

For now, TUDUM with <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum." target="_blank">Netflix </a>
