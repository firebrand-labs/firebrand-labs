let’s embark on a new topic, the ABC of marketing – alphabets, the brand and what they communicate.

every observed brand defying the conventional rules of english? an onslaught on the application of language, if we may call them. this trend has risen since the internet became a household name. more so after digital momentum overtook reality.
