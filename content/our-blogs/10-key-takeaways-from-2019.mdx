2019 has been significantly important for all of us here. From a marketing services agency, we are transforming and are fast transitioning into a full services brand experience agency.

    - year of change

    change is the only constant. in the last year, we have acknowledged the need to change perspectives and adapt to what clients require in order to thrive in rapidly changing environments.

    - driven by insights

    understanding our customers’ behavior patterns and perceptions through research is important. hence, insights into the “how” of things is crucial to driving change.

    - power of collaboration

    there’s power in collaborating between a multidisciplinary team. as we grew in size we revamped our teams to accommodate people from diverse backgrounds encouraging holistic problem-solving capabilities.

    - asking tons of questions

    the deeper you understand a brand challenge, the clearer the solution. it is critical to seek answers by asking the right questions. questions that drive clarity.

    - constantly reviewing

    the importance of consistent reviews with the team helps in ensuring we stay on track to our plans. there’s more accountability and transparency between teams and managers.

    - staying agile

    importance of agility in a digital world. Cutting down on hierarchy, empowering teams to make decisions.

    - fitness & health

    physical health precedes mental health. good state of physical and mental well being is necessary to be at our best version of ourselves. hence, we took up a lot of fitness challenges that included keeping off alcohol, reducing smoking, taking up a sport and more.

    - bonding through travel

    over 4 trips. from beaches to mountains to new cities. we travelled together. we bonded better. we got to know each other. it had a better impact when we got back to our workplace. travelling had that impact on us.

    - continuously & consciously learning

    from guinness record-holding illustrators to attending design festivals to our weekly ‘the friday compass’ sessions, we realised it is important to make learning a continuous process. so much so, today, learning is one aspect for individual appraisals.

    - hiring firebrands

    hiring people who have a unique character, a personality that’s very special only to them. every member of our team brings something more than just skills. curiosity and eagerness to learn, lead and grow can never be purchased from the job market. skills are easily available.
