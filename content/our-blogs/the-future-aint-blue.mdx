Talks of flying cars, microchips embedded in brains, automation, and a brewing global economic crises have created an air of ambiguity around the coming decade. When life is uncertain or in crisis, our survival instincts are hard-wired to gravitate towards the tried and tested versus the unknown. This thriving desire for a stable foundation to build onto in the new era is what inspired the Pantone colour institute to declare classic blue as the colour of the year. As Leatrice Eiseman, the executive director said “we are living in a time that requires trust and faith. It is this kind of constancy and confidence that is experienced by Pantone 19- 4052 classic blue, a solid and dependable blue hue we can rely on”. This trend would soon translate itself into marketing in the form of nostalgia marketing by tapping into a tension that people feel and giving them a slice of the past to soothe them. Creatives are likely to take inspiration from classic hits, famous historical events and figures, celebrities, and even old fads and trends to provoke emotional responses from the past and calm anxieties about the future.

We have come up with a colour scheme “Classic solace” which is inspired by the Pantone colour of the year. The colour reflects the feeling of comfort and warmth. Combinations from this colour palette can help design creatives that are not only calming to the eye but translate a feeling of warmth and comfort with respect to the brand.
