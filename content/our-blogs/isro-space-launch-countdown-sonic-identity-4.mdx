it is astonishing how much voices can contribute to some of the most memorable milestones in our life, as an individual or together as a country!

we write this with a rather heavy heart, as we mourn the passing of Mrs. Valarmathi N, whose voice rang out through the nation on the countless space launches we have witnessed with bated breath. her clear voice, with messages loud and concise, was one of the cornerstones of the experience when we gathered in groups across the nation to watch ISRO’s continued efforts to fly India higher up into space!

joining ISRO in 1984, Mrs. Valarmathi also happened to be the project director of India’s first ever indigenously designed Radar Imaging Satellite, RISAT-1, which was successfully launched from Sriharikota in 2012.

while the keen observers of the recent Aditya L1 satellite launch may have noted her absence, her sudden passing came as a shock to those in ISRO and otherwise. her last ever announcement was that of the Chandrayaan 3 launch. a sonic identity that will be remembered alongside the vessel, as an icon that played a significant role in the indian space journey.

thank you, valarmathi madam, for your excellence, and the memories.
