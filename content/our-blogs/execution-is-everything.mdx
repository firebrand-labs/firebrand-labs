In the marketing world, clients always have different, and often unique, requirements. They come with newer and usually very challenging problem statements. But all clients have one thing in common: Whatever they want, they want it delivered yesterday!

So, yes, agility is very critical in our business. At firebrand labs (FBL) we ensure that we stay nimble-footed so that we can respond to client requirements in record time. Yet, at the same time, we maintain a laser-sharp focus on our quality standards too. We simply don’t compromise on that front. This means that we can’t afford to ever drop catches. And, essentially therefore, long before finishers became integral to winning T20 cricket matches, at FBL we had made brilliant execution a fine art.

This is how we do it.

    - We behave like owners. Everyone at FBL is encouraged to own client mandates. Yes, when we think up creative ideas, we paint on a large canvas. We think like multinational companies would. We think without limitations and always explore what can be done by asking ourselves, “Why not?”. But when we get down to developing and delivering a creative idea, we behave like kirana (grocery) store owners. We are hands-on, efficient and are micro-managing every single detail.
    - We communicate zealously. Every client mandate has several to-do items. And each item has to be processed within specific time frames. To ensure that there is no loss of information, and to avoid misunderstandings on delivery schedules and deadlines, we constantly share notes in person, and through messaging platforms like Slack and project management tools like Basecamp. Every small detail of every delivery schedule for every client is updated, virtually, 24/7.
    - We invest in knowing the client’s business. Great execution comes from a deep understanding of why we are doing something. If we think of a client mandate as a way to only earn money, we will never be as good as we are with executing it. Instead we think of our role as a marketing advisory that works on making our clients businesses more successful. We see ourselves as solving their business problems. And we know that to do this effectively, and efficiently, we must know their business as well as they do. Therefore, every team member at FBL is encouraged to deep dive and understand their clients’ business, the industries they operate in, and the way their clients make money. It is this understanding that helps us deliver and execute perfectly, on time, every single time.

When you look back at the history of marketing, or even of the world of business, there has never ever been a dearth of good, creative ideas. Almost anyone who challenges status quo comes up with a fresh idea. And whenever someone has faced a problem, they have always come up with an idea to solve it. So, in effect, ideas are always flowing freely. But ideas without action are useless. Only when an idea is back by diligent, systematic, disciplined, time- bound action does it go on to produce results.

This is why, at FBL, while we foster creativity, we celebrate and reward execution excellence. Over the last 15 years, our clients have come to count on us as a reliable partner because we not just good at coming up with creative solutions to their business problems, we are extremely good at executing these solutions.

To us, execution is winning. And, in business, winning is absolutely everything.
