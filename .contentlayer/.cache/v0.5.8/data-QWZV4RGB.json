It’s Citi. stick around to unravel the interesting story.\r\n\r\nciti wasn’t always known by its sleek lowercase. It was first called the first national city bank recognised as a one-bank holding company, first national city corporation or “Citicorp”.

But there is a lot more to design than just visual appeal.\r\n\r\nDesigning is both an art and a science.\r\n\r\nAs a marketing advisory firm, firebrand labs (FBL) constantly delivers mandates that involve design. From logos to websites to corporate pitch decks to promotional literature and marketing collaterals, all our work includes constantly producing evocative designs.\r\n\r\nEvery time we create a new design, a thumb rule that we follow is to ask ourselves if the design element in the brand’s identity and communication is functional. Which is, does the design go beyond just being visually appealing? Does the design reflect the brand’s values, its ethos and, therefore, help build its identity?\r\n\r\nTheoretically speaking, design-based identity is one way to grow and popularize a brand. For instance, consider the makeover of Air India after the Tata Group acquired the airline. Their first visible endeavor has been to change the brand’s logo and how it reflects on the outer body of each aircraft and inside it. But the brand’s identity-building effort is not just about changing a logo. A lot of study evidently has gone into developing this new logo. The history of the brand, its cultural connect to India’s people and its ambassadorship of India’s aviation sector have gone into the redesigning effort. So, in effect, Air India’s makeover involves creating a new identity. And, importantly, this is only the visible part.\r\n\r\nWhat is not visible yet is the work going on behind the scenes. This involves how the airline’s employees are working on internalizing the behavioral aspects of living by this new identity – which is, how they are working on improving the standards of customer service and experience.\r\n\r\nFor serious brand identity creators, like the team at FBL, design is as deep and soul-stirring as it is intellectually intense.\r\nRecently, a cutting-edge technology company came to us with a business challenge. They were having issues with being seen and counted as a serious employer of choice.\r\n\r\nAt a superficial level, redesigning their logo and embarking on an advertising campaign would have satisfied the client’s objectives. There would surely have been an immediate, visible impact on how they were being perceived.\r\n\r\nBut FBL recommended building a stronger and enduring brand identity. We undertook a brand-mapping exercise and conducted tone-of-voice studies. This led to the brand’s values and ethos being defined sharply. Only then was a redesign of the logo attempted.\r\n\r\nThe new logo reflected what the company stood for and showcased its vision to be an aggressive player in its space. The advertising strategy, therefore, was to creatively present the company’s values and culture. Each advertisement, both print and video, ended with an invitation to top-quality professionals to join the company so that “a new global IT institution could be built by coming together.”\r\n\r\nThe new identity and campaign were a huge hit. The company achieved its talent attraction plan in less that three months. This saved the company huge opportunity costs – in fact, it helped them with ramping up to grab new projects swiftly.\r\n\r\nAt FBL, we believe that design must not just look good. It must do a whole lot of good – to a company’s business performance and to its profitability.\r\n",

But all clients have one thing in common: Whatever they want, they want it delivered yesterday!\r\n\r\nSo, yes, agility is very critical in our business. At firebrand labs (FBL) we ensure that we stay nimble-footed so that we can respond to client requirements in record time. Yet, at the same time, we maintain a laser-sharp focus on our quality standards too. We simply don’t compromise on that front. This means that we can’t afford to ever drop catches. And, essentially therefore, long before finishers became integral to winning T20 cricket matches, at FBL we had made brilliant execution a fine art.\r\n\r\nThis is how we do it.\r\n\r\n    - We behave like owners. Everyone at FBL is encouraged to own client mandates. Yes, when we think up creative ideas, we paint on a large canvas. We think like multinational companies would. We think without limitations and always explore what can be done by asking ourselves, “Why not?”. But when we get down to developing and delivering a creative idea, we behave like kirana (grocery) store owners. We are hands-on, efficient and are micro-managing every single detail.\r\n    - We communicate zealously. Every client mandate has several to-do items. And each item has to be processed within specific time frames. To ensure that there is no loss of information, and to avoid misunderstandings on delivery schedules and deadlines, we constantly share notes in person, and through messaging platforms like Slack and project management tools like Basecamp. Every small detail of every delivery schedule for every client is updated, virtually, 24/7.\r\n    - We invest in knowing the client’s business. Great execution comes from a deep understanding of why we are doing something. If we think of a client mandate as a way to only earn money, we will never be as good as we are with executing it. Instead we think of our role as a marketing advisory that works on making our clients businesses more successful. We see ourselves as solving their business problems. And we know that to do this effectively, and efficiently, we must know their business as well as they do. Therefore, every team member at FBL is encouraged to deep dive and understand their clients’ business, the industries they operate in, and the way their clients make money. It is this understanding that helps us deliver and execute perfectly, on time, every single time.\r\n\r\nWhen you look back at the history of marketing, or even of the world of business, there has never ever been a dearth of good, creative ideas. Almost anyone who challenges status quo comes up with a fresh idea. And whenever someone has faced a problem, they have always come up with an idea to solve it. So, in effect, ideas are always flowing freely. But ideas without action are useless. Only when an idea is back by diligent, systematic, disciplined, time- bound action does it go on to produce results.\r\n\r\nThis is why, at FBL, while we foster creativity, we celebrate and reward execution excellence. Over the last 15 years, our clients have come to count on us as a reliable partner because we not just good at coming up with creative solutions to their business problems, we are extremely good at executing these solutions.\r\n\r\nTo us, execution is winning.

          "raw": "\r\nMarketing teams are constantly looking for content. And most of the content is targeted for creating posts on social media. Resultantly, there’s an endless hustle for videos, infographics, written posts and images.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone, every brand, is posting some content or the other all the time. But, honestly, how much of such content is engaging and useful for consumers of social media? And is social media the only vehicle for dissemination of such content? Also, is it true that people are only watching content as opposed to reading content? So, does that mean that marketers must use more video content instead of writing blog posts or generating posts on social media with written content?\r\n\r\nAt FBL we have researched extensively on these crucial questions and aspects of marketing. We understand that some of these perceived consumer behaviors are founded on myths and some are a result of marketers’ anxiety with wanting to stand out in the crowded online marketplace.\r\n\r\nOur experience over the last 15 years in working as a marketing advisory with brands and businesses has taught us that as long as the content is of high quality, it doesn’t necessarily have to be only video or short. Which is, content which is non-video or even long posts of written content work for marketing purposes.\r\n\r\n    - We follow a few key principles for creating high-quality content:\r\n    - Be crisp: What are you trying to tell your prospective customer? Is it sharp?\r\n    - Be clear: Does your content make a powerful case for your brand, product or service? Does it outline the value proposition in terms of costs and features? Can you define your pitch in a single line?\r\n    - Be creative: Can your pitch translate into a powerful creative – as a headline or a visual graphic or as a 30-second audio or video capsule?\r\n    - Be consistent: Whatever form of content you choose to use, be sure it is generated consistently. Whether video or written or audio, keep the content coming at regular intervals. Also, in each capsule of your content, keep the communication of the brand’s value proposition consistent.\r\n\r\nBe anecdotal: Let your content tell a story. It can be a true customer use case. Or you can weave a story around how you want the customer to benefit from your product or service. When people hear or read stories that appeal to them, they remember those stories. That’s really how you build better recall for your brand.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no one way of creating engaging content, what must be understood that is content that is not engaging is never remembered. For instance, none of us can recall the names of boring books we have read or boring movies that we have watched. Yet, those books and those movies that have left a deep impact on us are still vividly remembered by us. So it is with simple, powerful marketing campaigns of the past. You can still recall a favorite jingle or tagline or TV commercial. Think about these: “Yeh dil maange more” (Pepsi), “Hamara Bajaj”, “Boost is the secret of my energy”, “Don’t leave home without it” (AmEx) or “The Citi never sleeps”.\r\n\r\nIn a way, all of these marketing campaigns were built around interesting content and used across multiple media platforms.\r\nNow, think of all the video and written content that you have consumed on social media in the last few years. How many of them have been really memorable? Can you recall them now? How many of them will you be able to recall in a jiffy 25 years from now?\r\n\r\nWell, it is in your answer to those two questions that you can really come to appreciate the value of creating memorable content around your brand. Come to us at FBL. We will help you do just that.\r\n",

          "raw": "\r\nA company selling budget travel packages to exotic destinations got in touch with us seeking our expertise. They had spent a lot on roping in a social media influencer. Based on the influencer’s advice, they spent a lot of money on running a series of sponsored posts on a social media platform that primarily promotes video content. These posts featured the influencer traveling to various exotic vacation destinations across India. They company had hoped that their high spends would help promote their brand and their vacation packages.\r\n\r\nHowever, reality hit them hard when they evaluated the return on their investment after three quarters. Surely, their followership on the said social media platform had grown. But, despite all their efforts and spends, their holiday packages remained unsold.\r\n\r\nWhen we sat down with them, we asked them a simple question:\r\n\r\n“Is your objective to grow your social media following or is it to sell your holiday packages?”\r\n“Clearly, we want to sell our vacation packages. We are hungry for sales and\r\ngrowth,” exclaimed their CEO.\r\n\r\nWe told the CEO that his company was making a classic mistake: They had focused on the medium. Not the message. They were focused on tailoring their marketing content to suit what the social media platform’s users preferred seeing – beautiful-looking videos – instead of upselling their service and their packages.\r\n\r\nMarketers must understand an undeniable truth about marketing: The message is always more important than the medium. Now, the medium may change every couple of decades. For instance, almost a century ago, hand bills gave way to print media advertising. Then came TV commercials. And now there are sponsored social media videos and online ads. But the golden principle of marketing does not ever change. Your marketing effort must lead to the prospective customer either wanting to know more about your product or service, or better still, wanting to buy it. No advertising is worth it, if it can’t answer a simple, straightforward question: What do you want the customer, who is seeing your advertising, to do?\r\n\r\nWe advised the company to edit their travel videos so that they explicitly invited the customer to buy their packages. Their social media influencer was given a fresh, sharp brief: Pitch the travel packages directly. And, no prizes for guessing, this strategy worked wonders in record time.\r\n\r\nWithin a quarter, we advised the company to shoot short videos of customer stories of authentic experiences as testimonials and use them on the same social media platform. By the second half of the year, sales had grown by over 80%.\r\n\r\nAt firebrand labs (FBL), we encourage our clients to answer the following questions when we engage with them:\r\n\r\n    - Why are your marketing your product or service?\r\n    - What do you want your marketing effort/advertising to deliver?\r\n    - What are the top price and functional features of your product or service?\r\n    - Why should your customer choose your product or service over similar competing offers?\r\n    - What must the customer do to buy your product or service immediately?\r\n\r\nEvidently, these questions are not medium-specific. They are message-specific. The answers that our clients give us in response to these questions help us to help them sharpen their marketing pitch. They help us develop a very\r\nimpactful message that spur the client’s customers to act – to, importantly, make a purchase.\r\n\r\nWhen marketing, no matter what technology or medium you use, focus on the message. When the message is clear, a brand gains by way of sales and memorability. Conversely, when the message is lost, is missing or confusing, the medium gains.\r\n",

          "raw": "\r\nThe CEO of a fintech startup wanted us to explain what marketing is to her team. She wanted us to keep the explanation simple and easy to grasp. Given that the company’s team members were mostly finance professionals, she wanted us to demystify marketing and present it as we would to children.\r\n\r\nWell, as a marketing advisory, we are pretty well-versed with this brief. Because, we always believe that every creative idea that we deliver for our clients must pass the six-year-old test. Which is, it must be so simple that even a six year old must be able to understand it, relate to it and act on it.\r\n\r\nTo us, at firebrand labs (FBL), marketing is expert storytelling.\r\n\r\nNow, stories are never boring. But storytellers can bore you to death. Which is why we believe in telling stories that are true, authentic and relatable.\r\n\r\nImportantly, we tell them really, really well – expertly.\r\n\r\nLet’s explain how we do it.\r\n\r\nRecently, an iconic model, actor and filmmaker named Kavita Chaudhary passed away. She famously appeared as Surf’s (a Unilever brand) Lalitaji in a television commercial in the ‘80s in India. That particular advertising campaign for Surf was created by legendary adman Alyque Padamsee. The campaign showed Lalitaji, a housewife, bargaining aggressively with streetside vegetable vendors. Yet, when it came to choosing the right detergent for her home, she said she always chose Surf. Although Surf was more expensive than other brands, she explained, it was superior in terms of quality and performance. So, Lalitaji’s clarion call was: “Surf ki kharidaari mein hi samajhdhaari hai.” Which is, “Buying Surf is always a smart choice.” The Surf ad had a simple, powerful storyline: The lady of the house is smart. She knows when and where to bargain to save the household money. And, of course, she also knows when not to compromise on quality. Which means she would rather buy a high- performance product that is more expensive than settle for something that was cheaper and of inferior quality. The Lalitaji campaign worked wonders for Surf. The detergent’s sales went through the roof. In fact, most Indian housewives prided themselves with buying Surf because it portrayed them as smart people making an intelligent choice.\r\n\r\nAt FBL, we follow the style of storytelling that the Lalitaji ad campaign championed.\r\n\r\nWe believe that storytelling is the one key principle in marketing that will never quite change. Any brand, product or service, therefore, must keep their focus on storytelling when planning a marketing campaign. We encourage our clients to answer some simple questions that will aid them with keeping the campaign sharp:\r\n\r\n    - What are we trying to tell our customers about our offering – our product or service?\r\n    - Why must the customer buy our product or service?\r\n    - Is our storytelling authentic?\r\n    - Does it present the features of our product or service in a simple, easily understandable manner?\r\n    - Does our storytelling end with a call to action – preferably a direction to purchase our product or service?\r\n\r\nWe used this approach with the fintech company as well when they invited us to be their outsourced, extended chief marketing officer/office (ext. CMO).\r\n\r\nThe storyline we came up with for their campaign was to encourage homemakers to use the fintech firm’s specialized app for monthly payment of bills. We invited homemakers to break free from the challenges of paying their monthly bills for utilities to multiple parties using multiple apps and platforms. We talked about how simple, efficient and safe our client’s app is. Critically, once a payment method was linked to this app and it was set up to pay a bunch of bills each month, all it required was a monthly, one-time approval for bills to be paid. Which is, the app offered a single window payment service.\r\n\r\nThis meant that there was no need for the homemaker to remember multiple passwords or generate multiple OTPs. Our campaign for this client ended with a call to action and a powerful promise: “Download the app. Pay your bills. And chill.”\r\n\r\nSure enough, the campaign delivered remarkable results for this fintech company.\r\n\r\nClearly, storytelling through a product or service campaign is an art. At FBL, we specialize in this art. That’s what makes us tell campaign stories expertly.\r\n",

Simply, every client is anxious in their own way to gain followership on social media by running interesting campaigns all through the year.\r\n\r\nOne business owner, who runs a reputed eatery, articulated his need thus: “Until fifteen years ago, I ran weekly advertisements in two prominent English dailies and in neighborhood newspapers. But after social media became popular, I feel a sense of loss. I have tried managing the various social media handles for my business myself but we don’t seem to be gaining followers. I think we may become irrelevant as a brand in this digital age.”\r\n\r\nWe had a simple question to ask this business owner: How has the lack of followership on social media affected his business?\r\nHis response was an interesting one: “My business, thankfully, continues to do well. We have grown each year. And we still get our regular customers coming back, even as some younger, new ones come to check us out every now and\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\nThis short conversation with this business owner tells us a lot about how brands and businesses must learn to use social media. Importantly, social media and its role has to be understood. Mere social media presence or followership does not guarantee sales. Period.\r\n\r\nSocial media is just a tech-based, digital platform. Just as there were, and still are, radio spots, billboards, print media advertisements and TV commercials, there is social media too. It is yet another platform, just another medium.\r\n\r\nBut merely having followers, or not having them, means nothing. What brands need is that their visibility through any channel – social media or otherwise – must translate into sales.\r\n\r\nWe asked this business owner who owns the eatery what kind content he was posting on social media. He said he was largely sharing pictures every week.\r\nAnd that he was promoting special menus for special days like festivals, Valentin’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day and such. We noticed both a problem and an opportunity with what he told us.\r\n\r\nThe content he was sharing on social media was clearly uninteresting. That was the problem. Rather than promote “special” days, he needed to tell real stories of his customers. That was the opportunity.\r\n\r\nOur team swung into action. We shot video testimonials of the eatery’s customers. We created campaigns around these stories. And we ran these campaigns on all the social media handles of the business. The eatery’s followership went up. And so did sales, proportionately.\r\n\r\nThis business owner had been trapped in a classic situation. He did not know how to use social media.\r\n\r\nWhat social media allows brands to do is to tell stories using videos and pictures more effectively than other conventional media tools. TV commercials are very expensive. And billboards, radio spots and print media cannot carry the campaigns that social media can support. So brands have to use social media intelligently. And they must often use social media, in addition to, and not necessarily in lieu of, the conventional media tools.\r\n\r\nWhat changed the game for the eatery’s social media strategy was us leveraging the opportunity to tell real customer stories. This client already had a loyal customer base. We merely tapped into it. We switched his lacklustre effort of “celebrating special days” to doing something significant, to “celebrating the experiences of real people”. We now help the eatery celebrate each day and each key customer moments for the brand consistently, specially.\r\n",

It helps us keep the strategy sharp and relevant. Importantly, it helps us deliver whatever we have conceived remarkably well.\r\n\r\nMost marketing teams focus on the glossier and superficial aspects of a marketing plan for brands, products and services. They imagine that marketing is all about helping the brand amass a social media following. If they are a tad more creative, they throw in some innovative designs in their campaigns that make their communication and content look different. Truth be told, nothing can be more myopic about a marketing strategy than following this approach.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of marketing lies the responsibility to create an aspirational need in the consumer’s mind for a brand’s product or service. This means everyone who is in the marketing team must dive deep into the market to understand what their business is really all about and how their product or service is aiming to create value for their customers.\r\n\r\nSimply, coming up with a sound marketing strategy involves doing a lot of research, learning a lot from that research and understanding the space that the brand, product or service occupies very well.\r\n\r\nAt FBL, we have every member of our team work with a framework when we\r\naccept a client’s mandate:\r\n\r\nHow has the industry segment that the client operates in performed over the past decade? Who are the top players in this market? What are the top trends?\r\n\r\nWhat are the client’s competitors up to? What marketing strategies have they executed in the last three years? What are their customers talking about these brands, products and services? What does the internet tell us about these players?\r\n\r\nWhat is the value proposition that the client’s product or service is offering the market? Compared to other competing brands, products and services, how can our client’s offering occupy a unique position in the market? And, importantly, in their customers’ minds?\r\n\r\nIf the client is an established player in the market, what are people talking on the internet about this client?\r\n\r\nIn some cases, we conduct offline research as well. Which is, we talk to some of our clients’ customers directly. We do this over email, phone calls or in one-on-one meetings.\r\n\r\nAt the end of weeks-long research, we come up with a strategy that focuses on telling the client’s brand’s story. The story is often a simple one. It highlights the value that the client’s product or service is bringing to the market. And the story urges both trial and purchase. But to get to that point, to be able to tell that simple story, a lot of effort and time has gone into researching, learning and understanding the client’s business space.\r\n\r\nThe more marketers know of their industry, of their competitors, the better they get at marketing the goodness of their brand, product and service.\r\n\r\nResearching, learning and understanding the business space is a prerequisite to building a sound marketing strategy.

          "raw": "\r\nA client came to us with a clearly defined problem statement: Their top-class product was not selling. They wanted us to devise and execute a marketing plan for them.\r\n\r\nThis client manufactured ready-to-cook batter for making idlis and dosais, the staple south Indian dishes. Their packaging was elegant and environment friendly. Their pricing was competitive. They manufactured their batter at a sterile, high-quality plant in Chennai. Their distribution network was strong and covered most of the key retail stores in Chennai and other parts of urban Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\nThe branding was slick. And the client’s advertising budget was also substantial. Yet, even after over a year of being in the market, their batter was not selling.\r\n\r\nWe began with asking the question, “Why?”\r\n\r\nAfter spending quality time assessing their marketing strategy, we found an answer to our question in a grocery store in South Chennai. A homemaker told us that she did not pick up this client’s brand because the packaging said “Idly &\r\n\r\nDosa Batter”. She said that only north Indians referred to a dosai as dosa. So she believed that the company making the batter was from North India. “Living in Chennai, and when I can make it at home, why would I want to buy dosai batter made by a north Indian company,” she asked.\r\n\r\nThe client was startled by the homemaker’s candid feedback. But there lay a big lesson for them in her statement. The authentic way south Indians pronounce and spell the dish (in English) is dosai. However, across all parts of India, except in South India, people call the dish dosa. The dish is native to South India. And rightfully the local and native culture’s preference must be respected. This brand had clearly not done that.\r\n\r\nSurely, we advised the client that they change the word to dosai. The new packaging and all the advertising communication reflected the change quickly. We also recommended that their advertising strategy must have a significant amount of regional, vernacular content. So, in-store promos, radio spots and social media campaigns were all rolled out in Tamil.\r\n\r\nResultantly, the brand began to move well and sales have been steadily growing each quarter.\r\n\r\nRespecting culture is very important for brands to build their reputation and grow their business. In India, especially, native cultures vary from state to state. And from region to region. Marketing across India requires paying major attention to culturally sensitive communication. For instance, it is Deepavali in South India and Diwali in the rest of India. In Tamil Nadu the harvest festival is called Pongal, while in some other parts of India it is called Makar Sankranti.\r\n\r\nBrands must take care not to wish their customers in Tamil Nadu for Makar Sankranti. Pongal wishes will be in order though and highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the authentic name of the dish is dosai and not dosa. In South India another dish is called parotta, while in North India people make a dish called paratha. Both dishes are unique. Paratha is wheat-based. And parotta has wheat-based and maida-based variants. Selling these dishes in the market requires sharp, customized, culture-sensitive communication.\r\n\r\nAt FBL, we encourage all our clients to be sensitive and aware of India’s myriad regional cultures and traditions. And, importantly, we champion that these cultures be respected through sharp, customized communication.\r\n",

When the marketing strategy comes from this central, core idea, the marketing effort pays rich dividends. It builds the brand’s reputation, its identity and grows the business. But when this idea is either weak, or is completely missing, then the entire marketing strategy fizzles out.\r\n\r\nLet us share our experiences with you to illustrate this all-important point.\r\n\r\nOur client is a company that makes ready-to-eat south Indian food. They make a range of chutneys and variants of the popular dish, idli. Our client is a startup. They have limited budgets and are growing organically. Their main competitor is a brand that is owned by a large business house in Chennai. The competitor has access to their parent company’s reputation, funds, people and other related resources.\r\n\r\nWhen we began work with our client, we understood their core values. The promoter had spent over three decades in the corporate sector. His personal integrity and work ethic was always celebrated. He was committed to innovation, to maintaining high quality standards and to customer delight. We took this promoter’s core values and wove them into his food brand’s identity. The brand’s promise was thus derived: “Great-tasting, fresh food that will wow every customer, every time.” And the central idea of the marketing strategy was this: Upsell the freshness and the great taste of the food, the affordable pricing and the ease of ordering/receiving each order.\r\n\r\nWe took this central idea and used it in all promotions in the retail outlets where the brand was stocked. We carried customer feedback and reviews on the brand’s social media handles. We also had the promoter play the brand’s ambassador in several forums related to startups and food. Every time he spoke, he wore the brand identity, literally, on him, with the brand’s logo emblazoned on his shirt. He consistently spoke only of the three points that made up the core idea of his brand’s identity. Our marketing strategy produced remarkable results for this client in less than six months.\r\n\r\nImportantly, there was no print or online advertising that was undertaken.\r\n\r\nContrast this strategy with the competitor’s approach. They advertised majorly in print media, on radio and on social media. Yet their market share was not very significant. Our client owned the major share of the market – brand-wise, sales-wise and customer’s mindshare-wise.\r\n\r\nMarketing is a lot about being authentic. It is all about telling the truth in a very efficient and creative way. When you are authentic, people like you. When a brand is authentic, people buy it.

          "raw": "\r\nWe get asked this question a lot of times by our clients.\r\n\r\nAnd almost always this is our answer: Merely spending on social media does not immediately guarantee business results. Choosing what media to spend on and spending your marketing budget wisely is important.\r\n\r\nLet’s share with you the story of a large hospital that was originally based only in southern Tamil Nadu. The management wanted to expand operations to other parts of the state. This hospital has a specialization in offering critical care to cancer patients. They have a vision to be Tamil Nadu’s number one, go- to hospital for cancer treatment. Their CEO said they had spent substantially on advertising on all social media platforms. But when they measured the impact, they did not find that their marketing spend had significantly generated qualified, valid leads.\r\n\r\nThey came to firebrand labs (FBL) looking for help to get them more value for the money they were investing in social media marketing.\r\nWe recommended a simple, three-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n    - Run patient and doctor stories through a sponsored video campaign on specific social media platforms.\r\n    - Run a print media campaign in Chennai and other cities in Tamil Nadu introducing their hospital through these patients and doctor stories.\r\n    - Run a series of events in public forums in Chennai and other cities in Tamil Nadu to talk about cancer care. These events too must have stories of patients and doctors featuring in them.

One year down the line, they became a well-known hospital chain across Tamil Nadu. Importantly, their doctors are now recognized as experts in cancer care. Also, several thousand qualified, valid leads have been generated annually due to the brand’s increased visibility and reputation.\r\n\r\nFBL’s marketing strategy for this client is based on a reality that every business leader and brand needs to understand about marketing in the digital age. Social media is not the only avenue for marketing. It is just one of the channels.\r\n\r\nSo social media spends must be carefully and intelligently planned. Merely advertising on social media does not guarantee any brand business success. Just as you cannot use a print media publication or TV channel beyond its circle of influence, you cannot expect social media advertising to produce results if your customers are not likely to be there.\r\n\r\nA brand must ask itself some important questions:\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, these questions have not changed with the advent of the digital age. These are the same questions that marketers have asked themselves when planning marketing campaigns for decades now. These questions have not changed for over a century and they are unlikely to ever change.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the answer to the second question that social media offers brands a new channel, a new vehicle. Like print media, TV, events and public relations offered brands vehicles to reach customers, in the digital age, social media is just another vehicle. It is just another marketing channel.\r\n\r\nAlso, the quality of the content that your marketing campaign offers is very important. Merely promoting your product or service is not enough. Your campaign must reflect a theme, it must tell stories. It is because FBL built a campaign around the stories of patients and doctors that our client’s hospital gained visibility, stature and business.\r\nSocial media is not the answer to your marketing needs.

          "raw": "\r\nA startup’s founder came to us with a critical business need. She wanted to increase sales.\r\n\r\nHer startup was about two years old around then. She is a veteran in the luggage business. Her company makes backpacks for school kids, young adults, professionals and travelers.\r\n\r\nShe had a five-member in-house marketing team. She also had contracted with a digital marketing agency to handle social media promotions for her brand.\r\n\r\nBut after a full year of spending on the team, on the agency, and on several promotions, she had come to the conclusion that her approach to marketing was not working. She fired her team and the agency.\r\n\r\n“I am not against spending on marketing. But I need to see our sales going up. I want to see our brand being talked about. I need more accountability from whoever is leading our marketing effort,” she emphasized, even as she gave firebrand labs (FBL) the mandate to be her startup’s outsourced chief marketing officer/office (CMO).\r\n\r\nFBL brought to this founder and her startup the benefits of our powerful, outsourced, extended CMO (ext. CMO) model. As a marketing advisory, FBL offered this client its services on several critical fronts: creative thinking, designing, advertising, problem-solving, research, analytics and writing.\r\n\r\nResultantly, in just over six months, sales at this startup rose by 20%. Also, analytics of the performance of the brand’s social media campaigns showed a 25% organic growth in engagement levels and followership.\r\n\r\nThese results have been achieved at a budget that is 25% lesser than what the company would have spent had it retained their earlier marketing model, of working with an in-house team and a digital marketing agency. Importantly, while the company did not see any significant sales coming from their marketing initiatives in their initial years in business, they saw tangible, measurable results in just six months of working with us.\r\n\r\nThis client story points to a few truths that marketers must recognize and hold dear:\r\n\r\n    - Marketing has two key roles to perform: It must grow awareness of a product and service in such a way that this awareness delivers increased sales. And, simultaneously, marketing must grow the aura and reputation of the brand.\r\n    - In a world that is heavily reliant on digital communication, marketers, brands and companies imagine that gaining followership on social media platforms and advertising on them are the only ways to do marketing. This is not quite true. Digital marketing and advertising on social media are just additional ways to market a product, service or brand. You still need to effectively use the traditional marketing channels: print media, TV, radio, outdoor media, events and public relations.\r\n    - The agency model of marketing is dead. You can no longer count on hiring an agency to handle your advertising releases for a percentage of your advertising budget. You need a partner who has their skin in the game.\r\n    - As new, young talent comes into the mainstream of the professional workforce, business leaders must realize that this talent pool lacks experience in the traditional and timeless principles of marketing. Only an outsourced, ext. CMO, led by marketing industry veterans with over 25 years of experience, can bring ownership and high-quality creative thinking to the table.\r\n\r\nOne of the key strengths of FBL was evident in the way we fulfilled this backpack startup’s mandate. We painstakingly reasoned the rationale for every rupee that the client had to spend and linked their budget to results. This is how performance marketing works. This is the unbeatable value proposition that an ext. CMO brings to your enterprise: It thrives on execution excellence and not just on creative ideas. It delivers business results.\r\n",

They’re our subconscious “Rajini title cards” to memorable, positive experiences.\r\n\r\nThere are a host of brands that haven’t changed elements of their now-iconic packaging for several decades and are now stories of phenomenal success.\r\n\r\nThis is why we see endless knock-offs like Abibas, KFC (Kozhi Fried Chicken, and yes, this does exist!), or even Sunbucks Coffee. All to piggyback on the kind of associations one resonates with the originals like Adidas Originals! Hey, we also wrote about how lettering works with Adidas Originals and a few other brands too.
