The next decade will witness more companies solving for energy solutions. We will have designers anchoring the creation of electric aeroplanes, construction of tokamak reactors(nuclear fusion reactors), building floating windmills & solar solutions.

He had no gargantuan visions for the future, rarely micromanaged or called out directions, never held anyone accountable for not following rules or processes and had a quiet demeanor that contradicted the common notion of a dynamic design leader with energy that captivated the room.\n\nThis intrigued me.\n\nHence, I set out to illustrate his predominant character traits as charts only to realise that he is more than a manager, he is a leader who led his team with authenticity. While a lot of these charts were lighthearted, they opened my eyes to the truth that the antithesis of a manager is a design leader.\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://x687dt1j5j.ufs.sh/f/pTbrMlXytQXi1groxdD7g3autyIcM42eqsf6Vb5PvXwEiWU0\"\n  width=\"300\"\n  height=\"300\"\n  className=\"mt-4\"\n  alt=\"citi\"\n/>\n\n**Antithesis #1**\n\n<h3 className=\"text-foreground font-heading leading-normal tracking-normal text-tertiary-heading\">\n  Passion does not give meaning to your life, passion is what gives meaning to\n  your suffering.\n</h3>\n\nI had imagined a passionate leader to be someone with a great vision coupled with the ability to motivate the team, someone who was certain of their decisions and communicated the same animatedly with high energy, until I came across an excerpt from one of Todd Henry’s books. The quote said “Great work requires suffering for something beyond yourself. It’s created when you bend your life around a mission and spend yourself on something you deem worthy of your best effort.”\n\nAfter working at the same workplace for 10 years as a designer and now as the head of design, Arun sir logs into work at 10am with the rest of the team but he is consistently the last person to leave the office. Even after constant suggestions on delegating work better and not carrying over work into every weekend, never have i heard him complain about being overworked or work hastily. The joy on his face while being immersed in his design work until he was entirely satisfied with the creative outcome redefined passion for me and rekindled the passion of his teammates.\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://x687dt1j5j.ufs.sh/f/pTbrMlXytQXinvinbzEVwhOJ7TEdmoR6uY0eA3fScrGMWDl9\"\n  width=\"300\"\n  height=\"300\"\n  alt=\"citi\"\n  className=\"mt-4\"\n/>\n\n**Antithesis #2**\n\n<h3 className=\"text-foreground font-heading leading-normal tracking-normal text-tertiary-heading\">\n  It is important to be heard, it is most important to hear people out.\n</h3>\n\nWhat is the role of a leader in times of conflict? Is it to actively resolve the conflict by backing what is logically right? Or Use your wisdom to give direction?

Watching him patiently hear all sides of the story, actively acknowledging how they feel while asking them questions that nudge them towards looking at the bigger picture, makes me understand the power of empathy. Conflict in opinions and interest is bound to happen in any team.

A good design process can factor in the iterative nature of design and even the divergent nature of creative thinking but great creative solutions stem from a creative state of mind. What it takes to achieve this state of mind is too complex to be factored into a process.\n\nArun sir consciously factors in the belief that all human beings are emotional and understands that it is impractical to expect your team to leave all emotional baggage at the door every morning as they step into work. It is also just as difficult to leave what happens at work behind at work, A emotionally draining work place is sure to impact your overall mental wellbeing and the quality of your personal life. In the course of the last year I have learnt the difference between completing a design task and completing the task really well. While a task completed solves the problem and has no one complaining, a great design solution thrills your stakeholders and creates more impact than you set out to create. When you have a talented team it is the intangible things like the right environment and being in a good mental space that increase your chances of creating great work, consistently.

          "raw": "\n24 years since it began claiming sole rights to the colour purple (Pantone 2685C), early this year Cadbury’s has lost the long battle to own the right to trademark the signature purple, which has been used for the packaging since 1905. The fact that the proceedings lasted for over two decades and the extensive money spent by Cadbury’s closest competitor Nestle to oppose this claim brings to light the power of owning a specific color in building a brand. With 80% of our human experience filtered through our eyes, visual experience is the very first perception customers will have with your brand. Thought through, researched and meticulously chosen colors define a brand’s value, strengthen and support brand positioning, enable greater awareness and distinguish the brand amongst its alternatives.\n\nColor registrations are notoriously difficult to obtain but brands like Tifannys that enjoy a rare and enviable position where consumers recognize the brand simply by seeing the color—even without any other brand identity prove that it is worth it. In 1998, Tiffany & Co. finally trademarked its color and packaging. Three years later, the brand partnered with Pantone to establish its hue: “1837 Blue,” commemorating its founding year. The company can paint anything, with its trademark color, the Tiffanys blue and it will always resonate with the brand, even in the absence of the logo or the brand name. While Tiffany has turned this distinctive shade into an international icon of elegance and sophistication, it is important to acknowledge that brand color is not essentially the color of the logo as the Tiffany logo is black.\n\nChanging the color of the logo to match shifting trends could be a strategy for some brands. At the recent launch of the revamped social platform, Mark Zuckerberg the CEO of Facebook said the company’s “F” icon was refreshed “to make it a bit more lively and modern”. Brighter colors tend to look more modern because they don’t appear to be restricted by darker, earthier print pigments. McDonald’s a brand synchronized with its famous kiddie meal stated it would shed its trademark red-and-yellow colors for a more mature look with muted colors in order to attract an increasing number of adults.

But there is a lot more to design than just visual appeal.\n\nDesigning is both an art and a science.\n\nAs a marketing advisory firm, firebrand labs (FBL) constantly delivers mandates that involve design. From logos to websites to corporate pitch decks to promotional literature and marketing collaterals, all our work includes constantly producing evocative designs.\n\nEvery time we create a new design, a thumb rule that we follow is to ask ourselves if the design element in the brand’s identity and communication is functional. Which is, does the design go beyond just being visually appealing? Does the design reflect the brand’s values, its ethos and, therefore, help build its identity?\n\nTheoretically speaking, design-based identity is one way to grow and popularize a brand. For instance, consider the makeover of Air India after the Tata Group acquired the airline. Their first visible endeavor has been to change the brand’s logo and how it reflects on the outer body of each aircraft and inside it. But the brand’s identity-building effort is not just about changing a logo. A lot of study evidently has gone into developing this new logo. The history of the brand, its cultural connect to India’s people and its ambassadorship of India’s aviation sector have gone into the redesigning effort. So, in effect, Air India’s makeover involves creating a new identity. And, importantly, this is only the visible part.\n\nWhat is not visible yet is the work going on behind the scenes. This involves how the airline’s employees are working on internalizing the behavioral aspects of living by this new identity – which is, how they are working on improving the standards of customer service and experience.\n\nFor serious brand identity creators, like the team at FBL, design is as deep and soul-stirring as it is intellectually intense.\nRecently, a cutting-edge technology company came to us with a business challenge. They were having issues with being seen and counted as a serious employer of choice.\n\nAt a superficial level, redesigning their logo and embarking on an advertising campaign would have satisfied the client’s objectives. There would surely have been an immediate, visible impact on how they were being perceived.\n\nBut FBL recommended building a stronger and enduring brand identity. We undertook a brand-mapping exercise and conducted tone-of-voice studies. This led to the brand’s values and ethos being defined sharply. Only then was a redesign of the logo attempted.\n\nThe new logo reflected what the company stood for and showcased its vision to be an aggressive player in its space. The advertising strategy, therefore, was to creatively present the company’s values and culture. Each advertisement, both print and video, ended with an invitation to top-quality professionals to join the company so that “a new global IT institution could be built by coming together.”\n\nThe new identity and campaign were a huge hit. The company achieved its talent attraction plan in less that three months. This saved the company huge opportunity costs – in fact, it helped them with ramping up to grab new projects swiftly.\n\nAt FBL, we believe that design must not just look good. It must do a whole lot of good – to a company’s business performance and to its profitability.\n",

          "raw": "\nHumans crave novelty, pleasure, and dopamine & endorphins.\n\nResearch has it that activation of different senses in the body helps us produce more of these hormones, thereby increasing our happiness.\n\nThese are relatively common knowledge nowadays. Every person who aspires to be a product manager, UX designer, or marketer expects to understand human psychology. But a few years back, when the internet was at its nascent stage, two men, Roger Thomas and Steve Wynn teamed up to defy the odds at a time when psychology was not as big a movement. They took a whopping 1.6 billion dollar gamble on psychology and constructed The Bellagio casino, which serves as the Sharma-Ji ka beta of the casino world.\n\nWhat makes Bellagio stand out amongst its competitors and predecessors? Why are psychologists, interior designers and casino enthusiasts so interested & intrigued about this particular casino? What makes this the crown jewel of the casino world? The answer lies in its design. Up until Bellagio, a casino’s design confused users, made them feel adrift and put them under stress while gambling & this was the biggest drawback of the classic casinos. Wynn & Thomas understood this problem and reimagined the casino experience. An experience in which people are always happy, as when they are happy, they tend to forget reality & lose track of what’s happening around them. Also, people overspend when they are emotionally safe and secure.\n\nThe dynamic duo tapped this aspect of human nature to design an experience where even the smell within the casino triggered people to be ecstatic.

But all clients have one thing in common: Whatever they want, they want it delivered yesterday!\n\nSo, yes, agility is very critical in our business. At firebrand labs (FBL) we ensure that we stay nimble-footed so that we can respond to client requirements in record time. Yet, at the same time, we maintain a laser-sharp focus on our quality standards too. We simply don’t compromise on that front. This means that we can’t afford to ever drop catches. And, essentially therefore, long before finishers became integral to winning T20 cricket matches, at FBL we had made brilliant execution a fine art.\n\nThis is how we do it.\n\n    - We behave like owners. Everyone at FBL is encouraged to own client mandates. Yes, when we think up creative ideas, we paint on a large canvas. We think like multinational companies would. We think without limitations and always explore what can be done by asking ourselves, “Why not?”. But when we get down to developing and delivering a creative idea, we behave like kirana (grocery) store owners. We are hands-on, efficient and are micro-managing every single detail.\n    - We communicate zealously. Every client mandate has several to-do items. And each item has to be processed within specific time frames. To ensure that there is no loss of information, and to avoid misunderstandings on delivery schedules and deadlines, we constantly share notes in person, and through messaging platforms like Slack and project management tools like Basecamp. Every small detail of every delivery schedule for every client is updated, virtually, 24/7.\n    - We invest in knowing the client’s business. Great execution comes from a deep understanding of why we are doing something. If we think of a client mandate as a way to only earn money, we will never be as good as we are with executing it. Instead we think of our role as a marketing advisory that works on making our clients businesses more successful. We see ourselves as solving their business problems. And we know that to do this effectively, and efficiently, we must know their business as well as they do. Therefore, every team member at FBL is encouraged to deep dive and understand their clients’ business, the industries they operate in, and the way their clients make money. It is this understanding that helps us deliver and execute perfectly, on time, every single time.\n\nWhen you look back at the history of marketing, or even of the world of business, there has never ever been a dearth of good, creative ideas. Almost anyone who challenges status quo comes up with a fresh idea. And whenever someone has faced a problem, they have always come up with an idea to solve it. So, in effect, ideas are always flowing freely. But ideas without action are useless. Only when an idea is back by diligent, systematic, disciplined, time- bound action does it go on to produce results.\n\nThis is why, at FBL, while we foster creativity, we celebrate and reward execution excellence. Over the last 15 years, our clients have come to count on us as a reliable partner because we not just good at coming up with creative solutions to their business problems, we are extremely good at executing these solutions.\n\nTo us, execution is winning.

          "raw": "\nMarketing teams are constantly looking for content. And most of the content is targeted for creating posts on social media. Resultantly, there’s an endless hustle for videos, infographics, written posts and images.\n\nAlmost everyone, every brand, is posting some content or the other all the time. But, honestly, how much of such content is engaging and useful for consumers of social media? And is social media the only vehicle for dissemination of such content? Also, is it true that people are only watching content as opposed to reading content? So, does that mean that marketers must use more video content instead of writing blog posts or generating posts on social media with written content?\n\nAt FBL we have researched extensively on these crucial questions and aspects of marketing. We understand that some of these perceived consumer behaviors are founded on myths and some are a result of marketers’ anxiety with wanting to stand out in the crowded online marketplace.\n\nOur experience over the last 15 years in working as a marketing advisory with brands and businesses has taught us that as long as the content is of high quality, it doesn’t necessarily have to be only video or short. Which is, content which is non-video or even long posts of written content work for marketing purposes.\n\n    - We follow a few key principles for creating high-quality content:\n    - Be crisp: What are you trying to tell your prospective customer? Is it sharp?\n    - Be clear: Does your content make a powerful case for your brand, product or service? Does it outline the value proposition in terms of costs and features? Can you define your pitch in a single line?\n    - Be creative: Can your pitch translate into a powerful creative – as a headline or a visual graphic or as a 30-second audio or video capsule?\n    - Be consistent: Whatever form of content you choose to use, be sure it is generated consistently. Whether video or written or audio, keep the content coming at regular intervals. Also, in each capsule of your content, keep the communication of the brand’s value proposition consistent.\n\nBe anecdotal: Let your content tell a story. It can be a true customer use case. Or you can weave a story around how you want the customer to benefit from your product or service. When people hear or read stories that appeal to them, they remember those stories. That’s really how you build better recall for your brand.\n\nWhile there is no one way of creating engaging content, what must be understood that is content that is not engaging is never remembered. For instance, none of us can recall the names of boring books we have read or boring movies that we have watched. Yet, those books and those movies that have left a deep impact on us are still vividly remembered by us. So it is with simple, powerful marketing campaigns of the past. You can still recall a favorite jingle or tagline or TV commercial. Think about these: “Yeh dil maange more” (Pepsi), “Hamara Bajaj”, “Boost is the secret of my energy”, “Don’t leave home without it” (AmEx) or “The Citi never sleeps”.\n\nIn a way, all of these marketing campaigns were built around interesting content and used across multiple media platforms.\nNow, think of all the video and written content that you have consumed on social media in the last few years. How many of them have been really memorable? Can you recall them now? How many of them will you be able to recall in a jiffy 25 years from now?\n\nWell, it is in your answer to those two questions that you can really come to appreciate the value of creating memorable content around your brand. Come to us at FBL. We will help you do just that.\n",

They company had hoped that their high spends would help promote their brand and their vacation packages.\n\nHowever, reality hit them hard when they evaluated the return on their investment after three quarters. Surely, their followership on the said social media platform had grown. But, despite all their efforts and spends, their holiday packages remained unsold.\n\nWhen we sat down with them, we asked them a simple question:\n\n“Is your objective to grow your social media following or is it to sell your holiday packages?”\n“Clearly, we want to sell our vacation packages. We are hungry for sales and\ngrowth,” exclaimed their CEO.\n\nWe told the CEO that his company was making a classic mistake: They had focused on the medium. Not the message. They were focused on tailoring their marketing content to suit what the social media platform’s users preferred seeing – beautiful-looking videos – instead of upselling their service and their packages.\n\nMarketers must understand an undeniable truth about marketing: The message is always more important than the medium. Now, the medium may change every couple of decades. For instance, almost a century ago, hand bills gave way to print media advertising. Then came TV commercials. And now there are sponsored social media videos and online ads. But the golden principle of marketing does not ever change. Your marketing effort must lead to the prospective customer either wanting to know more about your product or service, or better still, wanting to buy it. No advertising is worth it, if it can’t answer a simple, straightforward question: What do you want the customer, who is seeing your advertising, to do?\n\nWe advised the company to edit their travel videos so that they explicitly invited the customer to buy their packages. Their social media influencer was given a fresh, sharp brief: Pitch the travel packages directly. And, no prizes for guessing, this strategy worked wonders in record time.\n\nWithin a quarter, we advised the company to shoot short videos of customer stories of authentic experiences as testimonials and use them on the same social media platform. By the second half of the year, sales had grown by over 80%.\n\nAt firebrand labs (FBL), we encourage our clients to answer the following questions when we engage with them:\n\n    - Why are your marketing your product or service?\n    - What do you want your marketing effort/advertising to deliver?\n    - What are the top price and functional features of your product or service?\n    - Why should your customer choose your product or service over similar competing offers?\n    - What must the customer do to buy your product or service immediately?\n\nEvidently, these questions are not medium-specific. They are message-specific. The answers that our clients give us in response to these questions help us to help them sharpen their marketing pitch. They help us develop a very\nimpactful message that spur the client’s customers to act – to, importantly, make a purchase.\n\nWhen marketing, no matter what technology or medium you use, focus on the message. When the message is clear, a brand gains by way of sales and memorability. Conversely, when the message is lost, is missing or confusing, the medium gains.\n",

          "raw": "\nHow Google uses a different methodology to improve user intent to understand web page and rank the content higher.\n\nThere is no denying the fact that optimizing content for search engines will increase traffic, engagement, conversions, and sales. There is often difficulty figuring out how search engine optimization (SEO) works in fine detail. Is it possible to write search engine-friendly content that ranks well?\n\nStart thinking like a search engine (in a new way)\nGoogle places great importance on search intent. If you are fortunate to be one of the first to notice an algorithmic change in time, you can reap significant rewards while everyone else is playing catch up. According to Google’s latest Quality Rater Guidelines , search intent is a top priority.\n\nGoogle has faced a lot of difficulties in improving its search relevance, thanks to Rankbrain. In October 2015, Google launched the RankBrain algorithm based on machine learning. AI was used to interpret search queries for the first time.\n\nWe learned about Google’s workings, how it ranks web pages, and what metric changes and increases traffic. Many have taken advantage of this data to manipulate metrics such as links, keyword stuffing, and thin content to rank for multiple search terms.\n\n“Adding synonyms or semantically related words to a page by itself doesn’t necessarily make a page rank better for a specific query term. – Bill Slawski”\n\nMatching user intent with relevant content was still a major challenge for Google. With the BERT, Google made a breakthrough in machine learning.\n\nKeywords have long been the key to SEO, but natural language processing (NLP) leverages content.\nIn October 2019, about 10 percent of search queries were affected by BERT. Google’s BERT algorithm emphasizes content quality, context, and natural language processing (NLP). Google uses natural language processing to understand the context and sentiment behind it.\n\n“Google used to analyze words and phrases individually as part of its keyword research process. These days, search engines look at sentences, paragraphs, and a query as a whole. They also focus on sentiment analysis of content.”\n\nHave you considered wondering about your Monday morning?\n\nYou wake up, turn off the alarm, get out of bed although begrudgingly and start your day. You inadvertently check your emails, slack and whatsapp. Even as you are driving, when you are stuck in traffic, you keep checking your email and slack multiple times even though you might have seen it only moments before.\n\nRecognise a pattern here? Recognise how we have been habituated to using these products? That is the answer. That is the power of great design. It isn’t necessarily flashy, abstract or gaudy. Like air, you won’t necessarily notice it, but you’ll definitely notice the lack of it.\n\n_Essentially, the question you ought to ask yourself is, ‘How can I make my product/app a verb?’. One of the founding members of Dunzo, Kabeer Biswas put it beautifully when he said, ‘We wanted Dunzo to become a verb’ and so it has!_\n\nIncreasingly, Google is understanding the natural language better. Be sure to write good, relevant, and meaningful content for your users. To create unique and topically rich content, marketers need to shift from keyword-based approaches.\n\nCreating powerful and authentic content remains important for natural search. When planning your content, you will want to keep a few things in mind.\n\n**For Content Creators**\nWrite content that answers common queries clearly and concisely before going into more specific details.\n\n    - Do In-depth keyword research. (From Ahrefs: Lookout on phrase match, having same terms, also rank for, also talk about, search suggestions, newly discovered & questions) -> Include all of them in your list.\n    - Make your users’ lives easier by creating comprehensive resources instead of creating dozens of short, different pages.\n    - Intent-based targeting is a more effective approach than keyword targeting. Rather than creating content around particular keywords or broad topics, you should write content directly related to the searcher’s intent.\n    - For example, the queries “Android vs iPhone” or “compare Apple and Android phones” clearly fall under the category of “compare smartphones.”\n    - Organize keywords according to search intent & Cluster keywords into each content type (how-to, reviews, list, etc)\n    - When other sites offer more value than ours, mention them.\n\n**For Website Owners**\nSearch engines will better index your website if your website structure is logical and understands how the content relates to each other.\n\n    - Optimize niche relevance through the context-based topical hierarchy. Ensure your contents are in simple language for passage indexing & featured snippet\n    - Address more relevant topics that can be linked naturally. Minimize your links on the page to avoid diluting the topical authority\n    - Make structured data available to search engines to help them understand your content. (Creative work, Event, Organization, Person, Place, Product, Video)\n    - Improve page experience by concentrating on the following web essential elements ( Interactivity, Visual Stability, Loading, Mobile-Friendliness, HTTPS, No Intrusive Interstitials, and Safe Browsing).\n\n**For CMOs**\nBuild a strong foundation for your brand and content strategy. Be sure your content creation strategy aligns with your goals.\n\n    - Make content that will benefit your business in the short- and long term.\n    - Focus on optimizing the bottom and middle of the funnel\n    - Make sure the site content shows expertise, authority, and trustworthiness\n    - Ask your marketing team to cite claims and facts if you fall into the YMYL category (Your Money or Your Life). A YMYL website is one that focuses on topics that may have an impact on the readers’ quality, health, and financial wellbeing.\n    - Additionally, provide your users with helpful customer service information, contact and purchase information. This is why information pages such as About, Contact, FAQ can improve the credibility of your YMYL site.\n    - Use content management tools.\n    - Analyze results, set goals, and track progress\n    - Know your users, solve issues, and leverage well-written content.\n\n**SEO is timeless**\nUnderstanding how Google processes content is crucial to SEO. In the era of search engines that are becoming better at understanding user intent, context, and the relationships between concepts, the old-school SEO techniques like low-quality content, building a lot of links won’t cut it anymore.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, good content should be both human-friendly and search engine-friendly (noticing that people should always be the priority).\n\nIn addition to being relevant and high-quality, content should be technically optimized for indexing, ranking as well as focusing on the intent and user experience of the searcher.\n\nAchieving that balance is the key to success.\n",

          "raw": "\nThe CEO of a fintech startup wanted us to explain what marketing is to her team. She wanted us to keep the explanation simple and easy to grasp. Given that the company’s team members were mostly finance professionals, she wanted us to demystify marketing and present it as we would to children.\n\nWell, as a marketing advisory, we are pretty well-versed with this brief. Because, we always believe that every creative idea that we deliver for our clients must pass the six-year-old test. Which is, it must be so simple that even a six year old must be able to understand it, relate to it and act on it.\n\nTo us, at firebrand labs (FBL), marketing is expert storytelling.\n\nNow, stories are never boring. But storytellers can bore you to death. Which is why we believe in telling stories that are true, authentic and relatable.\n\nImportantly, we tell them really, really well – expertly.\n\nLet’s explain how we do it.\n\nRecently, an iconic model, actor and filmmaker named Kavita Chaudhary passed away. She famously appeared as Surf’s (a Unilever brand) Lalitaji in a television commercial in the ‘80s in India. That particular advertising campaign for Surf was created by legendary adman Alyque Padamsee. The campaign showed Lalitaji, a housewife, bargaining aggressively with streetside vegetable vendors. Yet, when it came to choosing the right detergent for her home, she said she always chose Surf. Although Surf was more expensive than other brands, she explained, it was superior in terms of quality and performance. So, Lalitaji’s clarion call was: “Surf ki kharidaari mein hi samajhdhaari hai.” Which is, “Buying Surf is always a smart choice.” The Surf ad had a simple, powerful storyline: The lady of the house is smart. She knows when and where to bargain to save the household money. And, of course, she also knows when not to compromise on quality. Which means she would rather buy a high- performance product that is more expensive than settle for something that was cheaper and of inferior quality. The Lalitaji campaign worked wonders for Surf. The detergent’s sales went through the roof. In fact, most Indian housewives prided themselves with buying Surf because it portrayed them as smart people making an intelligent choice.\n\nAt FBL, we follow the style of storytelling that the Lalitaji ad campaign championed.\n\nWe believe that storytelling is the one key principle in marketing that will never quite change. Any brand, product or service, therefore, must keep their focus on storytelling when planning a marketing campaign. We encourage our clients to answer some simple questions that will aid them with keeping the campaign sharp:\n\n    - What are we trying to tell our customers about our offering – our product or service?\n    - Why must the customer buy our product or service?\n    - Is our storytelling authentic?\n    - Does it present the features of our product or service in a simple, easily understandable manner?\n    - Does our storytelling end with a call to action – preferably a direction to purchase our product or service?\n\nWe used this approach with the fintech company as well when they invited us to be their outsourced, extended chief marketing officer/office (ext. CMO).\n\nThe storyline we came up with for their campaign was to encourage homemakers to use the fintech firm’s specialized app for monthly payment of bills. We invited homemakers to break free from the challenges of paying their monthly bills for utilities to multiple parties using multiple apps and platforms. We talked about how simple, efficient and safe our client’s app is. Critically, once a payment method was linked to this app and it was set up to pay a bunch of bills each month, all it required was a monthly, one-time approval for bills to be paid. Which is, the app offered a single window payment service.\n\nThis meant that there was no need for the homemaker to remember multiple passwords or generate multiple OTPs. Our campaign for this client ended with a call to action and a powerful promise: “Download the app. Pay your bills. And chill.”\n\nSure enough, the campaign delivered remarkable results for this fintech company.\n\nClearly, storytelling through a product or service campaign is an art. At FBL, we specialize in this art. That’s what makes us tell campaign stories expertly.\n",

          "raw": "\nThis piece brings together two of my favourite worlds – movies and design. More often than not, we are caught in the narrative, the festivity, the stardom, the glamour, the romance, the action and more that we tend to overlook the finer nuances of design that are so meticulously thought out when it comes to movie communication. Back in the day, teasers, teaser glimpses, first single, second single, behind the scenes and more were virtually non-existent. There were only 2 elements that screamed marketing and promotion – a trailer and POSTERS! Posters are the tapestry that adorned the corporation of Chennai. Be it politics, religion, or cinema, posters held a special place in the scheme of things. Unfortunately today, thanks to digitisation, Jio, smartphones, Instagram, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and other unrelated factors, movie posters are no longer the murals that kindle our curiosity, they are merely an action item in an exhaustive list of promotional materials that need to be designed and nine out of ten times, it is released on Twitter or Instagram first and printed very sparsely.\n\nSo as an ode to movie posters, here’s celebrating 5 of my favourite movie posters:\n\n    - **Shawshank Redemption** – The movie doesn’t just provide redemption from Shawshank, but from negativity and disdain at large. However, that is a conversation for another day. As far as the poster is concerned, the Shawshank Redemption poster is set in grayscale with an overcast overlay akin to Andy’s time in prison. His time in prison was far from safe, yet, there remained hope, for hope is the best of things and the beam of light hitting Andy from above is the epitome of that emotion.\n    - **Lakshya** – Over the last one week or so, I have been obsessing about this movie. I believe it is because it inspires me to overcome the challenges in my path and attain my goal. What is beautiful about the Lakshya poster is the typeface that becomes progressively bolder as we move from L to A symbolising Karan’s journey from a boy to a man forged in the fires of war. Minimalism epitomised.\n    - **Super Deluxe** – Complex, bizzare, vivid, confusing, amazing, ‘what the frak was that’, these are a few emotions one goes through while watching this masterpiece from thyagaraja kumararaja. The poster is a perfect ode to that sentiment. A juxtaposition of multiple colours, hand-drawn elements and multiple font styles symbolise the multiple emotional layers the movie unveils as it progresses.\n    - **Jallikattu** – Lijo Jose Pellissery takes edgy to a completely different plane altogether with Jallikattu. Chaotic, bloody, violent, loud, rustic, and dark Jallikattu is not for the weak-stomached to sit through. Yet, it captures so many emotions that the urban-dweller cannot even fathom. Interestingly, the poster too, designed with clay/wet mud is as imperfect, rustic, and chaotic as the movie itself. Design is consistency across all mediums and the designer nailed the brief!\n    - **Jigarthanda** – The loudest announcement of Karthik Subbaraj’s arrival was Jigarthanda but it was also the emergence of a phenomenon, Assault Sethu. The movie revolves around how Karthik, in an attempt to make a gangster movie in Madurai ends up getting too close to a ruthless gangster Assault Sethu. Interestingly, he is forced to make the movie he set out to make with Assault Sethu as the hero and an ensemble of emotions ensue. The artwork of Jigarthanda is just as flippant as the movie itself in vibrant pink and neon blue. However, the intricacy lies in the unfinished art in each of the posters, it is a testament to how Karthik wasn’t able to complete anything he took up – be it his romantic interest, the movie he wanted to make or the life he wanted to live. The devil is in the details? No. Design is.\n\nWhat are some of your favourite movies and are their posters interesting too? Comment below!\n",

          "raw": "\n‘Your information is for sale. You have become the product’\n\nDo you realise the profound grimness of this statement? This isn’t a quote by a leader or a visionary, it is the copy on Apple’s new ad about their app tracking transparency feature. Yet, it hits home, for it is true!\n\nThe birth of the world wide web was the stepping stone into the information age and it was a golden period that helped the world stay connected, learn more, explore more, voice out more openly, and genuinely drove worldwide transformation. However, similar to our exploits with previously found superpowers – industry and oil/fossil fuels, we have mined it to an unfathomable extent. Akin to the need for sustainable alternatives and a circular economy to overcome our overconsumption, the need for privacy and data protection is imperative to create a safe, free and harmonious digital world not infested with ads and promotions.\n\nImagine this, you are talking to your girlfriend about what brand of face wash you should order, or what sneakers you should gift yourself, and immediately you are smacked in the face with an ad from a cosmetics brand and a shoe brand – HOW CREEPY IS THAT? How is it any different from a bunch of people stalking you home everyday and looking over your shoulder every second of every minute of every day?\n\nFor instance, watch this ad by apple, even though it is exaggerated to prove a point, it is true to the extent of apps tracking our every move and dishing out ads that are apparently “personalised” to us. This isn’t personalisation, this is a flagrant violation of consumer privacy.\n\nWell, guess what, Apple and Google have lost their chill and rightly so.\n\nBoth these giants have made decisions that will have a lasting impact on the world of digital marketing and warrants a paradigm shift in the way marketers approach “targeted” advertising and have set a great precedent for companies to follow.\n\nApple’s App Tracking Transparency Update:\n\nThe latest iOS 14.6 update and the imminent iOS 15 update across 1.6 billion mobile and laptop/computer devices has rendered app tracking and ‘targeted’ advertising obsolete in one fell swoop.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nPreviously, any app on your phone could track your data such as location, age, credit card information, preferences, interests and more. What’s worse? This data was made available for data brokers and advertisers to serve you with personalised advertisements.\n\nNow, with the app tracking transparency update, you get to ‘OPT IN’ and choose whether or not you want to let an app track your data. The latest privacy dashboard Apple has proposed in iOS 15 gives a user access to a detailed overview about the nature of data extracted, how often it is done and who has access to this information. This gives you the ability to filter and stop any third party from accessing your data, truly lending meaning to the word privacy.\n\nSimilarly, with the mail privacy protection, the software stops senders from gathering data about users such as:\n\n    - IP address\n    - Open rate\n    - Time of open and more\n\nWatch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G05nEgsXgoI\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> for more information.\n\n**A cookie-less world by Google Chrome**\n\nGoogle’s mission of ’do good’ is further emphasized by their decision to eliminate cookies altogether from their proprietary browser, Chrome.\n\nThe marketer in you would go, ‘OMG! How do we remarket and offer personalised ads?’, the answer is you don’t offer personalised ads based on a user’s profile, instead offer ads to an entire group of people with similar interests or in marketing jargon – cohorts.\n\nPresenting **FLoCs**.\n\nFLoC – Federated Learning of Cohorts replaces Cookies as personal identifiers, instead uses cohorts(groups of people with similar interests) to create user profiles thereby effectively masking a person’s identity while enabling personalised advertisements.\n\nAs a marketer and a consumer, these updates are bittersweet (more sweet than bitter), however, here’s how marketers need to adapt to changing times:\n\n    - Focus on ZPD-based strategies – Zero Party Data(ZPD) is the information shared willingly by consumers to make their app experience better – similar to how you share your interests as you log into netflix or spotify. ZPD provides very powerful insights into a user’s mind and behaviour and helps marketers create strategies that are personalised and yet non-infringing.\n    - Incentivise data sharing – Could you create a value proposition ecosystem where your users/consumers are incentivized to share valuable data that you can utilise for your marketing campaigns and advertising.\n    - Geo-tagging + Existing User profiles – Marketers could leverage a combination of geography based tagging/targeting among existing user profiles to identify cohorts and behaviour patterns to glean insights.\n\nThe precedent set by Apple and Google is important for creating a fair and just ecosystem, one that fosters real connections between users without being constantly tracked, hounded and sold to.\n\nWhile these policies/reforms seem to be a step in the right direction, we will need to wait to see if these directly translate into a shift in the marketers’ mindset.\n\nStay tuned as we breakdown more information surrounding privacy, how it will affect digital marketers and our predictions for the future.\n\nThis article is part 1 of a 3-part series surrounding privacy and digital marketing.\n",

Simply, every client is anxious in their own way to gain followership on social media by running interesting campaigns all through the year.\n\nOne business owner, who runs a reputed eatery, articulated his need thus: “Until fifteen years ago, I ran weekly advertisements in two prominent English dailies and in neighborhood newspapers. But after social media became popular, I feel a sense of loss. I have tried managing the various social media handles for my business myself but we don’t seem to be gaining followers. I think we may become irrelevant as a brand in this digital age.”\n\nWe had a simple question to ask this business owner: How has the lack of followership on social media affected his business?\nHis response was an interesting one: “My business, thankfully, continues to do well. We have grown each year. And we still get our regular customers coming back, even as some younger, new ones come to check us out every now and\nthen.”\n\nThis short conversation with this business owner tells us a lot about how brands and businesses must learn to use social media. Importantly, social media and its role has to be understood. Mere social media presence or followership does not guarantee sales. Period.\n\nSocial media is just a tech-based, digital platform. Just as there were, and still are, radio spots, billboards, print media advertisements and TV commercials, there is social media too. It is yet another platform, just another medium.\n\nBut merely having followers, or not having them, means nothing. What brands need is that their visibility through any channel – social media or otherwise – must translate into sales.\n\nWe asked this business owner who owns the eatery what kind content he was posting on social media. He said he was largely sharing pictures every week.\nAnd that he was promoting special menus for special days like festivals, Valentin’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day and such. We noticed both a problem and an opportunity with what he told us.\n\nThe content he was sharing on social media was clearly uninteresting. That was the problem. Rather than promote “special” days, he needed to tell real stories of his customers. That was the opportunity.\n\nOur team swung into action. We shot video testimonials of the eatery’s customers. We created campaigns around these stories. And we ran these campaigns on all the social media handles of the business. The eatery’s followership went up. And so did sales, proportionately.\n\nThis business owner had been trapped in a classic situation. He did not know how to use social media.\n\nWhat social media allows brands to do is to tell stories using videos and pictures more effectively than other conventional media tools. TV commercials are very expensive. And billboards, radio spots and print media cannot carry the campaigns that social media can support. So brands have to use social media intelligently. And they must often use social media, in addition to, and not necessarily in lieu of, the conventional media tools.\n\nWhat changed the game for the eatery’s social media strategy was us leveraging the opportunity to tell real customer stories. This client already had a loyal customer base. We merely tapped into it. We switched his lacklustre effort of “celebrating special days” to doing something significant, to “celebrating the experiences of real people”. We now help the eatery celebrate each day and each key customer moments for the brand consistently, specially.\n",

They imagine that marketing is all about helping the brand amass a social media following. If they are a tad more creative, they throw in some innovative designs in their campaigns that make their communication and content look different. Truth be told, nothing can be more myopic about a marketing strategy than following this approach.\n\nAt the heart of marketing lies the responsibility to create an aspirational need in the consumer’s mind for a brand’s product or service. This means everyone who is in the marketing team must dive deep into the market to understand what their business is really all about and how their product or service is aiming to create value for their customers.\n\nSimply, coming up with a sound marketing strategy involves doing a lot of research, learning a lot from that research and understanding the space that the brand, product or service occupies very well.\n\nAt FBL, we have every member of our team work with a framework when we\naccept a client’s mandate:\n\nHow has the industry segment that the client operates in performed over the past decade?

In Tamil Nadu the harvest festival is called Pongal, while in some other parts of India it is called Makar Sankranti.\n\nBrands must take care not to wish their customers in Tamil Nadu for Makar Sankranti. Pongal wishes will be in order though and highly appreciated.\n\nSimilarly, the authentic name of the dish is dosai and not dosa. In South India another dish is called parotta, while in North India people make a dish called paratha. Both dishes are unique. Paratha is wheat-based. And parotta has wheat-based and maida-based variants. Selling these dishes in the market requires sharp, customized, culture-sensitive communication.\n\nAt FBL, we encourage all our clients to be sensitive and aware of India’s myriad regional cultures and traditions. And, importantly, we champion that these cultures be respected through sharp, customized communication.\n",

Companies such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Freshdesk and even Google offer a host of services/solutions to improve the quality of lives of people and businesses.\n\n**But, first, what is SaaS?**\n\nSoftware as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications online—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.\n\nLocal example: Zoho is a world leader in SaaS. Based out of Chennai, Zoho offers a host of services such as Zoho People for Human Resource Management, Zoho Social, a customer resource management tool, Zoho Payroll, a payroll management tool among many others. All of these tools are hosted on Zoho’s own servers, yet, we can access them from anywhere remotely, on a convenient monthly basis through subscription.\n\n‘Cool. Thanks for the clarification. But what does design have to do with this?’, we can hear you ask this question from a mile away.\n\nTo summarise what is to follow in one line, **‘Great design is the only thing that differentiates one SaaS product/service from another. PERIOD!’**\n\nMost local restaurants today offer home delivery services. Yet, we choose a Zomato or a Swiggy. Why? Is it due to the offers, the convenience or the reliability? A bit of everything. In short, we choose Swiggy/Zomato as they have better design. Easier to order, easier to track, easier to pay, the design makes your life so much easier.\n\nEven among these two contemporaries, we choose one over the other in certain scenarios owing to how we experience their interfaces or in other words, how these apps are designed.\n\nFor instance, swiggy has better complaint redressal in comparison to Zomato. Yet, Zomato has better offers than Swiggy. It boils down to the trade off you as a customer is willing to make. Nonetheless, great design and consumer understanding is at the core of their success.\n\n**How do I incorporate great design to my product/service?**\n\nThe answer is simple.\n\nHave you considered wondering about your Monday morning?\n\nYou wake up, turn off the alarm, get out of bed although begrudgingly and start your day. You inadvertently check your emails, slack and whatsapp. Even as you are driving, when you are stuck in traffic, you keep checking your email and slack multiple times even though you might have seen it only moments before.\n\nRecognise a pattern here? Recognise how we have been habituated to using these products? That is the answer. That is the power of great design. It isn’t necessarily flashy, abstract or gaudy. Like air, you won’t necessarily notice it, but you’ll definitely notice the lack of it.\n\nEssentially, the question you ought to ask yourself is, ‘How can I make my product/app a verb?’. One of the founding members of Dunzo, Kabeer Biswas put it beautifully when he said, ‘We wanted Dunzo to become a verb’ and so it has!\n\nFactors to consider while creating a habit-forming experience:\n\n    - User Experience or UX: We have seen many throw around this word casually, ‘I think the UX needs to be fixed’ or ‘Seamless UX is the name of the game’ and all that jazz. To put it simply, UX is how your user experiences your product. Are they able to easily access all the features you want them to? Are they able to navigate between screens easily? Is there an easier way in which they can reach out to you? So on, so forth. Right from the layout of the product to how easily they understand what problem of theirs you will be able to solve, everything hinges on a good user experience.\n    - Make your users work a bit: The most important part of habit formation is ‘investment’. Allowing opportunities for customisation and personalisation makes the user invested in your product increasing the likelihood of them sticking around. For instance, if your product/app has many of their songs, contacts or messages, they will surely stick around for all these have intrinsic value to them.\n    - Content: Ah! The most undervalued commodity of all. It is sad really that people think content and design are separate functions. Great content accents your design. Period! I go back to my current favourite consumer app, Dunzo as I speak about content. Their filmy, easy to relate, highly memorable content makes my app experience ‘entertaining’ and ‘chuckle-worthy’ and I keep going back to them time and again. Similarly, cred, the credit card app has great content that makes you sit up and take note. Over time, your users tend to share these notifications with people and automatically, your product has them habituated.\n    - Tease them with trials: If you think users will buy your product/subscription right off the bat, you are either a noob or highly ambitious or worse, both! It is essential to give them a taste of what to experience and bait them into biting the hook as you reel them in. *Fishing metaphor successfully incorporated*\n\nAs SaaS continues to grow exponentially, great design becomes all the more imperative. Be ahead of the curve when it comes to creating a kickass user experience.\n\nIf you have an idea in mind, let’s see how we can make it a verb, or a habit! Let’s talk.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Under Section 30(2)(a) of the Trademark Act, fair use of a trademark in a descriptive manner by a third party is permitted insofar as it is in relation to goods or services of the trademark holder/proprietor indicating the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of services or other characteristics of goods or services.

          "raw": "\nA couple of months into the new decade, the much anticipated 2020, had sports lovers excited about the tokyo olympics, science geeks looking forward to the mars 2020 space mission and movie buffs eagerly waiting for the black widow to hit the screens until the novel coronavirus pandemic froze all plans. The rapidly spreading virus led to a race to hoard staples, crippled the economy and brought the world to a sudden halt. As the world stands still giving us time to introspect, like many others I am grappling with the question, will things ever go back to being as they were?\n\nI have come to realize that the most likely answer is NO. it’s the end of the world as we know it (and i feel fine)… I am not just quoting the lyrics of a popular rock song, I mean it! The macro systems and structures, like models of governance, societal beliefs, culture, lifestyle and age-old institutions that we have taken for granted have been put to test. When these massive establishments, the pillars that society is built on, are left with no choice but to evolve or break, there is bound to be a shift in the way the world functions. While we will have to wait a little longer to tell the magnitude of the shift, we can rest assured that the new challenges are bound to open new windows of opportunity to innovate and the future is not all bleak if we are ready to embrace change.\n\nI have touched upon some speculated changes in behaviors that we can expect to notice in both businesses and consumers in a post pandemic world. While some of these behaviours are being carefully developed by brands during the quarantine period the rest are a reflection of what we have been subjected to!\n\n**We are isolated but not alone**\nThe first and most obvious shift would be the gradual transition of our community engagement into digital realms. Though the world was digitally connected and people were spending a lot of time on social media, the more significant conversations were still had in person. Be it catching up with co workers during coffee breaks, catching up with extended family post religious congregations or watching sports with friends, these were the interactions that gave people a sense of belonging. Platforms like reddit have been successful in building anonymous digital communities in the recent past but everyone is looking at facebook, the applicatication that was threatened by allegations of bad ethics and the growth in popularity of its flashy sibling, instagram. Facebook has launched a community help feature in some parts of the world that enables neighbours to help each other during the pandemic. In the united kingdom alone facebook has successfully formed 300 coronavirus support groups with over a million members. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of facebook shared his vision to build social infrastructure to give people comfort that they are not alone and that there was a community looking out for them in his commencement address at harvard a couple of years ago. With his vision aligning with the current public need, will facebook find innovative ways to sustain these communities post the pandemic? Will new players capitalise on this need? Will established brands invest resources in building communities for their loyalists? Given that all intimate connections are traditionally formed in the absence of distraction and ads might make the experience less meaningful, Will the human need for deeper connection be monetised?\n**We crave familiarity during unfamiliar times**\nThe pandemic has replaced the examinations of customer journeys and satisfaction metrics on what customers want with innovative ways to address what they need. Scarcity in resources and the widespread panic caused by the contagion has left no room for indulgences. However, the crashing of global economies indicate that this trend might continue even post the lifting of the lockdown. BBC recently published an experiment that hinted that we become more conformist and respectful of convention when we feel the threat of a disease. Anything unconventional or eccentric, even invention and innovation, become less valued when you are overcoming the threat of an unknown contagion. While people are being dished out comfort and familiarity, the challenge lies in how businesses deeply understand the nuances of traditional modes and bring the same experience to them through new channels. Will nostalgia become a strong selling point? Will this aversion to innovation result in brands deploying additional resources in designing digital experiences that mimic the equivalent physical experience?\n**All we need is empathy**\nA pandemic is inclusive, it impacts everyone. The magnitude of the impact varies from region to region but the entire community has faced a blow in some form or the other. This collective loss has made people connect with each other with a strong sense of empathy. The self quarantine has given people the time to introspect about areas that they never deemed significant amidst their hectic lives.

When these massive establishments, the pillars that society is built on, are left with no choice but to evolve or break, there is bound to be a shift in the way the world functions.

Though the world was digitally connected and people were spending a lot of time on social media, the more significant conversations were still had in person. Be it catching up with co workers during coffee breaks, catching up with extended family post religious congregations or watching sports with friends, these were the interactions that gave people a sense of belonging. Platforms like reddit have been successful in building anonymous digital communities in the recent past but everyone is looking at facebook, the applicatication that was threatened by allegations of bad ethics and the growth in popularity of its flashy sibling, instagram. Facebook has launched a community help feature in some parts of the world that enables neighbours to help each other during the pandemic. In the united kingdom alone facebook has successfully formed 300 coronavirus support groups with over a million members. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of facebook shared his vision to build social infrastructure to give people comfort that they are not alone and that there was a community looking out for them in his commencement address at harvard a couple of years ago. With his vision aligning with the current public need, will facebook find innovative ways to sustain these communities post the pandemic? Will new players capitalise on this need? Will established brands invest resources in building communities for their loyalists? Given that all intimate connections are traditionally formed in the absence of distraction and ads might make the experience less meaningful, Will the human need for deeper connection be monetised?\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"We crave familiarity during unfamiliar times\"}),`\nThe pandemic has replaced the examinations of customer journeys and satisfaction metrics on what customers want with innovative ways to address what they need. Scarcity in resources and the widespread panic caused by the contagion has left no room for indulgences. However, the crashing of global economies indicate that this trend might continue even post the lifting of the lockdown. BBC recently published an experiment that hinted that we become more conformist and respectful of convention when we feel the threat of a disease. Anything unconventional or eccentric, even invention and innovation, become less valued when you are overcoming the threat of an unknown contagion. While people are being dished out comfort and familiarity, the challenge lies in how businesses deeply understand the nuances of traditional modes and bring the same experience to them through new channels. Will nostalgia become a strong selling point? Will this aversion to innovation result in brands deploying additional resources in designing digital experiences that mimic the equivalent physical experience?\n`,(0,i.jsx)(e.strong,{children:\"All we need is empathy\"}),`\nA pandemic is inclusive, it impacts everyone. The magnitude of the impact varies from region to region but the entire community has faced a blow in some form or the other. This collective loss has made people connect with each other with a strong sense of empathy. The self quarantine has given people the time to introspect about areas that they never deemed significant amidst their hectic lives. This period of introspection could result in reconsideration of priorities and choices leading to a lasting personal and economic impact highlighting that consumers are probably not making purchases but they are definitely making decisions.The increased need to connect with people they empathise with has led to an increase in live streams by brands,artists,renowned personalities and digital content creators.

          "raw": "\n2020 changed the world at large, and in more than one instance, for the better. Consumer behavior and consumption patterns have largely changed. There is a shift from reactive to preventive care. Especially in the Indian subcontinent, consumers are spending more and more every day to enhance their lifestyles and be more healthy. Similarly, the focus has shifted from being a do-it-for-me ecosystem to a let-me-do-it-myself ecosystem. As many of us donned the hats of chefs, hairstylists, housekeepers and more during the pandemic, we are constantly seeking ways to make our lives at home easier. Interestingly, spending patterns, especially among the GenZ community have shifted to a spend vs save mindset and today’s expenditure is contingent not only on the product but also the relevance, the purpose, the why of the brand and more.\n\nAll the aforementioned factors only cement my belief that experiential engagement is the way forward. The world today is no more seeking products, consumers of today seek experiences. Brands like CookD and other food product companies leveraged the prevalent DIY bubble to create recipe packs that enabled even the most novice of cooks to create a delicious meal. Similarly, health tech brands created VR gear to help simulate the experience of working out in the open while in reality they were working out from their living rooms. This trend has carried forward into multiple facets of reality including virtual office meetings, virtual gatherings with friends, virtual political campaigns and whatnot, and this trend is here to stay, case in point, metaverse.\n\nHow can then brands pivot to create experiential engagement?\n\n    - **Think human-first** – All the data, technology and budget in the world is obsolete if it doesn’t drive the desired result and one sure shot way to drive results is to think human-first. For instance, how can organizations that adopt a remote-first work environment ensure engaging onboarding or transition? It is the proverbial goldmine when it comes to experiential engagement.\n    - **Go phygital** – While COVID hasn’t been completely eliminated, the world at large has opened up and this creates an imperative need for phygital experiences. Think about this paradigm, you want to check-in to the oberoi hotel in Mumbai, but you do not want to interact with any other human being during this experience. Well, a truly human-free check-in experience enables this paradigm and it would be a trendsetter as far as the hospitality industry is concerned. Right from booking, to preferences, to sanitation, everything is taken care of digitally while you enjoy the experience physically. Phygital.\n    - **Adopt a multi-sensory approach** – Human beings are multi-sensory creatures, we like to engage multiple senses simultaneously. For engagement to be truly experiential, it must engage multiple senses at once. Case in point is the SPI cinemas movie-going experience. You are hooked at the grandeur of the screen, the comfort of the seats, the smell of buttery popcorn, the sound of ardent movie fans like you and more and want to come back again and again.\n    - **Practice empathy** – Be genuinely concerned about your consumer’s pain points and try to actively make their lives better. Ikea’s success hinges on their hinges (bad wordplay, but you get the point, right?). The entire brand experience is contingent on the fact that anybody can assemble Ikea furniture taking handymen and carpenters out of the equation, making lives of consumers all the more easy. Ikea practiced DIY long before it became a thing.\n    - **Let purpose drive you** – Today’s consumers go beyond what you offer and deep dive into what you believe as a brand/organisation and what you stand for. What you stand for Is an expression of who you are and it creates identity and relates with your audiences at a primal level, transforming them into loyalists. For instance, Uber’s support for the Black Lives Matter movement was both a stroke of PR genius and at the same time, genuine intentions and it resulted in widespread support for the brand.\n",

When the marketing strategy comes from this central, core idea, the marketing effort pays rich dividends. It builds the brand’s reputation, its identity and grows the business. But when this idea is either weak, or is completely missing, then the entire marketing strategy fizzles out.\n\nLet us share our experiences with you to illustrate this all-important point.\n\nOur client is a company that makes ready-to-eat south Indian food. They make a range of chutneys and variants of the popular dish, idli. Our client is a startup. They have limited budgets and are growing organically. Their main competitor is a brand that is owned by a large business house in Chennai. The competitor has access to their parent company’s reputation, funds, people and other related resources.\n\nWhen we began work with our client, we understood their core values. The promoter had spent over three decades in the corporate sector. His personal integrity and work ethic was always celebrated. He was committed to innovation, to maintaining high quality standards and to customer delight. We took this promoter’s core values and wove them into his food brand’s identity. The brand’s promise was thus derived: “Great-tasting, fresh food that will wow every customer, every time.” And the central idea of the marketing strategy was this: Upsell the freshness and the great taste of the food, the affordable pricing and the ease of ordering/receiving each order.\n\nWe took this central idea and used it in all promotions in the retail outlets where the brand was stocked. We carried customer feedback and reviews on the brand’s social media handles. We also had the promoter play the brand’s ambassador in several forums related to startups and food. Every time he spoke, he wore the brand identity, literally, on him, with the brand’s logo emblazoned on his shirt. He consistently spoke only of the three points that made up the core idea of his brand’s identity. Our marketing strategy produced remarkable results for this client in less than six months.\n\nImportantly, there was no print or online advertising that was undertaken.\n\nContrast this strategy with the competitor’s approach. They advertised majorly in print media, on radio and on social media. Yet their market share was not very significant. Our client owned the major share of the market – brand-wise, sales-wise and customer’s mindshare-wise.\n\nMarketing is a lot about being authentic. It is all about telling the truth in a very efficient and creative way. When you are authentic, people like you. When a brand is authentic, people buy it. And, importantly, they buy it again and again. This is what makes a marketing strategy powerful.\n\nMaking powerful marketing strategies is what firebrand labs (FBL) excels in.\n",

          "raw": "\nOver the last 15 years, I have personally worked with over 100+ clients, entrepreneurs and large enterprises. With every single one of them, from the time we first meet until the last day of sign-off, we work hard towards seeking their validation, approval and meet and exceed expectations. This is true not just for a creative service partner, I guess, anyone in the services space will be able to relate to this.\n\nYet, looking back, we have realized, 6 out of 10 of them have never worked with a ‘creative agency’, 2 have worked with ‘freelancers’ and the last 2 have a well-oiled system in place + adequate budgets.\n\nIn order to get some clarity, here’s a list i have made. This list will help anyone seeking to work with an agency:\n\n        - It begins with a well-defined problem statement. Can you clearly articulate what you want to be solved? Is it building a brand? Is it generating leads? Is it a go-to-market strategy? or anything else?\n        - Look for pedigree. For older agencies, seek references. For newer agencies look for hunger and passion.\n        - Review their portfolio. Look for their work specific to your problem area. If you are looking for packing designs, ask them to share similar work done.\n        - Seek references from their clients. Go one step forward and actually talk to one of their oldest clients. See what they have to talk about this potential agency partner.\n        - Exclusive spoc. If you are a founder / entrepreneur-led, then, have a dedicated spoc. Ensure you have one of your brightest, smartest minds work with the agency to get your work done.\n        - Begin with setting a budget. In your first or second meeting, set commercial expectations. ask for a proposal / understand the billing model.\n        - No freebies, please. If you are seeking proof of concept, pay for it. Nothing comes free. when you offer to pay, the agency will perceive you as a “good client” and will be willing to walk the extra mile for you and your business in the future.\n        - Embrace technology. Thanks to the pandemic, virtual meetings are a reality. It may be easier and faster to just do a virtual call than a physical meet-up.\n        - Look for a team. Not an individual. Though there are exceptions to this rule. A team means business continuity and less dependence on one person.\n        - Be responsive. Something that’s rare in today’s generation despite the best and most transparent communication tools available. Reply to that proposal shared.\n        - Look for happiness in an agency. Where people are happy, they create superior outcomes and experiences.\n        - Avoid poaching. Instead see if the founder allows one of his / her colleague to come and do a stint with you. Small companies find it extremely hard to hire and retain talent.\n        - Look for governance. Do they pay salaries on time? TDS and GST filing? A well-governed agency will take better care of your business. Make this non-negotiable.\n        - Observe their social handles. Most agencies build their own brands using social media. Look for creativity there. You can find inspiration. Seek out similar ideas that may be appropriate for your business.\n        - Ask yourself, how approachable / responsive / people friendly is the founder of the agency? If she responds to you, the chances are her colleagues will stay responsive. This list can go on and on. and, I believe this is a good enough to make a beginning.\n\nWe hope this list lets you onboard a partner who can become a trusted custodian for your brand.\n",

          "raw": "\nWe get asked this question a lot of times by our clients.\n\nAnd almost always this is our answer: Merely spending on social media does not immediately guarantee business results. Choosing what media to spend on and spending your marketing budget wisely is important.\n\nLet’s share with you the story of a large hospital that was originally based only in southern Tamil Nadu. The management wanted to expand operations to other parts of the state. This hospital has a specialization in offering critical care to cancer patients. They have a vision to be Tamil Nadu’s number one, go- to hospital for cancer treatment. Their CEO said they had spent substantially on advertising on all social media platforms. But when they measured the impact, they did not find that their marketing spend had significantly generated qualified, valid leads.\n\nThey came to firebrand labs (FBL) looking for help to get them more value for the money they were investing in social media marketing.\nWe recommended a simple, three-pronged approach:\n\n    - Run patient and doctor stories through a sponsored video campaign on specific social media platforms.\n    - Run a print media campaign in Chennai and other cities in Tamil Nadu introducing their hospital through these patients and doctor stories.\n    - Run a series of events in public forums in Chennai and other cities in Tamil Nadu to talk about cancer care. These events too must have stories of patients and doctors featuring in them. These events were to be aggressively promoted on both social media and print media.\n\nThe client backed our strategy and invested in it. One year down the line, they became a well-known hospital chain across Tamil Nadu. Importantly, their doctors are now recognized as experts in cancer care. Also, several thousand qualified, valid leads have been generated annually due to the brand’s increased visibility and reputation.\n\nFBL’s marketing strategy for this client is based on a reality that every business leader and brand needs to understand about marketing in the digital age. Social media is not the only avenue for marketing. It is just one of the channels.\n\nSo social media spends must be carefully and intelligently planned. Merely advertising on social media does not guarantee any brand business success. Just as you cannot use a print media publication or TV channel beyond its circle of influence, you cannot expect social media advertising to produce results if your customers are not likely to be there.\n\nA brand must ask itself some important questions:\n\nIf you think about it, these questions have not changed with the advent of the digital age. These are the same questions that marketers have asked themselves when planning marketing campaigns for decades now. These questions have not changed for over a century and they are unlikely to ever change.\n\nIt is only in the answer to the second question that social media offers brands a new channel, a new vehicle. Like print media, TV, events and public relations offered brands vehicles to reach customers, in the digital age, social media is just another vehicle. It is just another marketing channel.\n\nAlso, the quality of the content that your marketing campaign offers is very important. Merely promoting your product or service is not enough. Your campaign must reflect a theme, it must tell stories. It is because FBL built a campaign around the stories of patients and doctors that our client’s hospital gained visibility, stature and business.\nSocial media is not the answer to your marketing needs.

          "raw": "\nA startup’s founder came to us with a critical business need. She wanted to increase sales.\n\nHer startup was about two years old around then. She is a veteran in the luggage business. Her company makes backpacks for school kids, young adults, professionals and travelers.\n\nShe had a five-member in-house marketing team. She also had contracted with a digital marketing agency to handle social media promotions for her brand.\n\nBut after a full year of spending on the team, on the agency, and on several promotions, she had come to the conclusion that her approach to marketing was not working. She fired her team and the agency.\n\n“I am not against spending on marketing. But I need to see our sales going up. I want to see our brand being talked about. I need more accountability from whoever is leading our marketing effort,” she emphasized, even as she gave firebrand labs (FBL) the mandate to be her startup’s outsourced chief marketing officer/office (CMO).\n\nFBL brought to this founder and her startup the benefits of our powerful, outsourced, extended CMO (ext. CMO) model. As a marketing advisory, FBL offered this client its services on several critical fronts: creative thinking, designing, advertising, problem-solving, research, analytics and writing.\n\nResultantly, in just over six months, sales at this startup rose by 20%. Also, analytics of the performance of the brand’s social media campaigns showed a 25% organic growth in engagement levels and followership.\n\nThese results have been achieved at a budget that is 25% lesser than what the company would have spent had it retained their earlier marketing model, of working with an in-house team and a digital marketing agency. Importantly, while the company did not see any significant sales coming from their marketing initiatives in their initial years in business, they saw tangible, measurable results in just six months of working with us.\n\nThis client story points to a few truths that marketers must recognize and hold dear:\n\n    - Marketing has two key roles to perform: It must grow awareness of a product and service in such a way that this awareness delivers increased sales. And, simultaneously, marketing must grow the aura and reputation of the brand.\n    - In a world that is heavily reliant on digital communication, marketers, brands and companies imagine that gaining followership on social media platforms and advertising on them are the only ways to do marketing. This is not quite true. Digital marketing and advertising on social media are just additional ways to market a product, service or brand. You still need to effectively use the traditional marketing channels: print media, TV, radio, outdoor media, events and public relations.\n    - The agency model of marketing is dead. You can no longer count on hiring an agency to handle your advertising releases for a percentage of your advertising budget. You need a partner who has their skin in the game.\n    - As new, young talent comes into the mainstream of the professional workforce, business leaders must realize that this talent pool lacks experience in the traditional and timeless principles of marketing. Only an outsourced, ext. CMO, led by marketing industry veterans with over 25 years of experience, can bring ownership and high-quality creative thinking to the table.\n\nOne of the key strengths of FBL was evident in the way we fulfilled this backpack startup’s mandate. We painstakingly reasoned the rationale for every rupee that the client had to spend and linked their budget to results. This is how performance marketing works.

And the film begins without “Super Star Rajni” being animated with that fanfare around you.\n\nWould you feel the same about that “Thalaivar Padam”? Would it even be one?\n\nLet’s switch scenes now.\n\nIt’s a slushy, rainy day, and your throat feels sore. You open your medicine box hunting for a cough drop.\n\nWere you looking for a green triangular logo?\n\nThere is a good chance that you were.\n\nNow, imagine if Vicks came in a square container with a black logo.\n\nWould you even recognise that as a cough drop in your box of meds?\n\nWhy not?\n\nTo be able to answer that, let’s answer this first.\n\nHow many brands out there do you actually recall with your eyes closed? And what is the first thing you remember about that brand? Hold on to that answer!\n\nEvery time we see a product on the shelf or the rack, we aren’t just seeing it; we are creating a particular association with the product.\n\nThe more familiar we are with a product, the stronger the association, and these associations are more often than most based on a product’s colour, shape, size, and mode of packaging.\n\nAdditionally, the brain tends to group familiar things as good things. According to psychologist Robert Zajonc, this is referred to as the Mere Exposure Effect.\n\nSimilarly, this “familiarity of good things” leads us to group these associations to reliability and often, nostalgia. They’re our subconscious “Rajini title cards” to memorable, positive experiences.\n\nThere are a host of brands that haven’t changed elements of their now-iconic packaging for several decades and are now stories of phenomenal success.\n\nThis is why we see endless knock-offs like Abibas, KFC (Kozhi Fried Chicken, and yes, this does exist!), or even Sunbucks Coffee.
