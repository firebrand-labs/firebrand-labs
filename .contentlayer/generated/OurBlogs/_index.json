What makes us trust a brand?\n\nThat green logo and the perennially unchanged Vicks dabba stand for more than their functions; they are now symbols of trust, relief, and reliability, much like a mother’s hand on your forehead when you are under the weather.\n\nDeveloping such trust was definitely not luck. Let’s see how the humble dabba aided trust.\n\nHave we ever struggled to open a Vicks dabba and apply it? The container was designed to be round to keep access easy and uncomplicated, especially when someone is feeling under the weather. Simplicity is not just about costs; it’s about context.

      "raw": "\nAlmost all clients these days approach us with what they think is a critical, urgent need: They want us to help them with their social media strategy. Simply, every client is anxious in their own way to gain followership on social media by running interesting campaigns all through the year.\n\nOne business owner, who runs a reputed eatery, articulated his need thus: “Until fifteen years ago, I ran weekly advertisements in two prominent English dailies and in neighborhood newspapers. But after social media became popular, I feel a sense of loss. I have tried managing the various social media handles for my business myself but we don’t seem to be gaining followers. I think we may become irrelevant as a brand in this digital age.”\n\nWe had a simple question to ask this business owner: How has the lack of followership on social media affected his business?\nHis response was an interesting one: “My business, thankfully, continues to do well. We have grown each year. And we still get our regular customers coming back, even as some younger, new ones come to check us out every now and\nthen.”\n\nThis short conversation with this business owner tells us a lot about how brands and businesses must learn to use social media. Importantly, social media and its role has to be understood. Mere social media presence or followership does not guarantee sales. Period.\n\nSocial media is just a tech-based, digital platform. Just as there were, and still are, radio spots, billboards, print media advertisements and TV commercials, there is social media too. It is yet another platform, just another medium.\n\nBut merely having followers, or not having them, means nothing. What brands need is that their visibility through any channel – social media or otherwise – must translate into sales.\n\nWe asked this business owner who owns the eatery what kind content he was posting on social media. He said he was largely sharing pictures every week.\nAnd that he was promoting special menus for special days like festivals, Valentin’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day and such. We noticed both a problem and an opportunity with what he told us.\n\nThe content he was sharing on social media was clearly uninteresting. That was the problem. Rather than promote “special” days, he needed to tell real stories of his customers. That was the opportunity.\n\nOur team swung into action. We shot video testimonials of the eatery’s customers. We created campaigns around these stories. And we ran these campaigns on all the social media handles of the business. The eatery’s followership went up. And so did sales, proportionately.\n\nThis business owner had been trapped in a classic situation. He did not know how to use social media.\n\nWhat social media allows brands to do is to tell stories using videos and pictures more effectively than other conventional media tools. TV commercials are very expensive. And billboards, radio spots and print media cannot carry the campaigns that social media can support. So brands have to use social media intelligently. And they must often use social media, in addition to, and not necessarily in lieu of, the conventional media tools.\n\nWhat changed the game for the eatery’s social media strategy was us leveraging the opportunity to tell real customer stories. This client already had a loyal customer base. We merely tapped into it. We switched his lacklustre effort of “celebrating special days” to doing something significant, to “celebrating the experiences of real people”. We now help the eatery celebrate each day and each key customer moments for the brand consistently, specially.\n",

      "raw": "\nA client came to us with a clearly defined problem statement: Their top-class product was not selling. They wanted us to devise and execute a marketing plan for them.\n\nThis client manufactured ready-to-cook batter for making idlis and dosais, the staple south Indian dishes. Their packaging was elegant and environment friendly. Their pricing was competitive. They manufactured their batter at a sterile, high-quality plant in Chennai. Their distribution network was strong and covered most of the key retail stores in Chennai and other parts of urban Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe branding was slick. And the client’s advertising budget was also substantial. Yet, even after over a year of being in the market, their batter was not selling.\n\nWe began with asking the question, “Why?”\n\nAfter spending quality time assessing their marketing strategy, we found an answer to our question in a grocery store in South Chennai. A homemaker told us that she did not pick up this client’s brand because the packaging said “Idly &\n\nDosa Batter”. She said that only north Indians referred to a dosai as dosa. So she believed that the company making the batter was from North India. “Living in Chennai, and when I can make it at home, why would I want to buy dosai batter made by a north Indian company,” she asked.\n\nThe client was startled by the homemaker’s candid feedback. But there lay a big lesson for them in her statement. The authentic way south Indians pronounce and spell the dish (in English) is dosai. However, across all parts of India, except in South India, people call the dish dosa. The dish is native to South India. And rightfully the local and native culture’s preference must be respected. This brand had clearly not done that.\n\nSurely, we advised the client that they change the word to dosai. The new packaging and all the advertising communication reflected the change quickly. We also recommended that their advertising strategy must have a significant amount of regional, vernacular content. So, in-store promos, radio spots and social media campaigns were all rolled out in Tamil.\n\nResultantly, the brand began to move well and sales have been steadily growing each quarter.\n\nRespecting culture is very important for brands to build their reputation and grow their business. In India, especially, native cultures vary from state to state. And from region to region. Marketing across India requires paying major attention to culturally sensitive communication. For instance, it is Deepavali in South India and Diwali in the rest of India. In Tamil Nadu the harvest festival is called Pongal, while in some other parts of India it is called Makar Sankranti.\n\nBrands must take care not to wish their customers in Tamil Nadu for Makar Sankranti. Pongal wishes will be in order though and highly appreciated.\n\nSimilarly, the authentic name of the dish is dosai and not dosa. In South India another dish is called parotta, while in North India people make a dish called paratha. Both dishes are unique. Paratha is wheat-based. And parotta has wheat-based and maida-based variants. Selling these dishes in the market requires sharp, customized, culture-sensitive communication.\n\nAt FBL, we encourage all our clients to be sensitive and aware of India’s myriad regional cultures and traditions. And, importantly, we champion that these cultures be respected through sharp, customized communication.\n",

      "raw": "\nAt the heart of any marketing strategy lies a core idea. This idea comes from the core values of the brand being marketed. When the marketing strategy comes from this central, core idea, the marketing effort pays rich dividends. It builds the brand’s reputation, its identity and grows the business. But when this idea is either weak, or is completely missing, then the entire marketing strategy fizzles out.\n\nLet us share our experiences with you to illustrate this all-important point.\n\nOur client is a company that makes ready-to-eat south Indian food. They make a range of chutneys and variants of the popular dish, idli. Our client is a startup. They have limited budgets and are growing organically. Their main competitor is a brand that is owned by a large business house in Chennai. The competitor has access to their parent company’s reputation, funds, people and other related resources.\n\nWhen we began work with our client, we understood their core values. The promoter had spent over three decades in the corporate sector. His personal integrity and work ethic was always celebrated. He was committed to innovation, to maintaining high quality standards and to customer delight. We took this promoter’s core values and wove them into his food brand’s identity. The brand’s promise was thus derived: “Great-tasting, fresh food that will wow every customer, every time.” And the central idea of the marketing strategy was this: Upsell the freshness and the great taste of the food, the affordable pricing and the ease of ordering/receiving each order.\n\nWe took this central idea and used it in all promotions in the retail outlets where the brand was stocked. We carried customer feedback and reviews on the brand’s social media handles. We also had the promoter play the brand’s ambassador in several forums related to startups and food. Every time he spoke, he wore the brand identity, literally, on him, with the brand’s logo emblazoned on his shirt. He consistently spoke only of the three points that made up the core idea of his brand’s identity. Our marketing strategy produced remarkable results for this client in less than six months.\n\nImportantly, there was no print or online advertising that was undertaken.\n\nContrast this strategy with the competitor’s approach. They advertised majorly in print media, on radio and on social media. Yet their market share was not very significant. Our client owned the major share of the market – brand-wise, sales-wise and customer’s mindshare-wise.\n\nMarketing is a lot about being authentic. It is all about telling the truth in a very efficient and creative way. When you are authentic, people like you. When a brand is authentic, people buy it. And, importantly, they buy it again and again. This is what makes a marketing strategy powerful.\n\nMaking powerful marketing strategies is what firebrand labs (FBL) excels in.\n",
