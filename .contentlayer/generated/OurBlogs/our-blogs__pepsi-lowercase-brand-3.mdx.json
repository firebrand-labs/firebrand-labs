    "raw": "\r\ndo you remember brad’s drink? all in upper case letters in blue colours? the name might not ring a bell, but what if I told you it’s closely tied to a global beverage giant?\r\n\r\nwe come across several brands every day, and a few brands’ logos are ingrained in us and have earned that space in our minds. what makes us, the consumers, identify a logo?\r\n\r\nwill we still remember the #essence of a brand if its logo keeps changing? yes, we do! now, then ‘brad’s drink’ now ‘pepsi’ for several years, is one such exception and example. for almost 130 years, it has undergone 12 redesigns, every time with a new and fresh approach.\r\n\r\nwhy? there are many answers to this question. however, our answer to this question is simple. those changes were made to suit the trends, tastes, and thought processes of people during those times.\r\n\r\nremember the first swirl logo of pepsi-cola, then the swirl became thick, and the logo had 3D visuals; it got cooler, resonating more with the younger audience.\r\n\r\nin 2008, pepsi was ready for a facelift again, and the logo was simplified and flattened. no more serifs, no more uppercase. the pepsi globe was titled. since then, it has been in lowercase.\r\n\r\ndid the audience welcome it? certainly, not all reactions to the changes were positive, as some critics deemed them cheap, simple, lazy and soulless. nevertheless, pepsi remained resolute in its rebranding choice.\r\n\r\nour takeaways:\r\n\r\n    - the current logo evokes a smile every time we grab a pepsi can.\r\n    - it’s fresh, fun and energetic, and it embodies the friendly attribute of the brand.\r\n    - the informal and lowercase style suggests that pepsi is an easygoing and relatable brand, making it appealing to a younger demographic.\r\n\r\nnow, over to you all.\r\n\r\nlet us know your thoughts on the evolution of pepsi over all these years.\r\n",
